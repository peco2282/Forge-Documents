These define how the animation is carried out and how to use the clips defined in the armature file. Concepts The ASM contains parameters , clips , states , and transitions . States The Animation State Machine can be in many different states . You define which states there are in the states section. Transitions Transistions define which states are allowed to go to other states, for example allowing a closed state to go to an open state. Note Transitions do not define animations that are played between states, however. If you want to do that you must create an additional state that plays an animation then uses an event to go to the next state. Parameters Note Parameters are called TimeValues in the code, hence the naming convention of SomethingValue. All parameters take an input, usually the current game time in seconds as a float (factoring in partial ticks) and outputs another time. This output is then used as the input to a clip, telling it the current progress of the animation. Each parameter can either be defined in the ASM or when you load the ASM in the code. Load-time parameters are usually of the type VariableValue , which returns a value changeable in-code, ignoring its input. Other types allow you to do math on the input ( SimpleExprValue ), return a constant ( ConstValue ), refer to other parameters ( ParameterValue ), return the input unmodified ( IdentityValue ) and perform composition of two parameters ( CompositionValue ). Clips Note Clips can either be ASM-clips, ones that are defined in the ASM, or armature-clips, ones that are defined in the armature file. For the rest of this page, \u201cclips\u201d will refer to ASM-clips unless otherwise stated. A clip takes in an input, usually the time, and does something to the model with it. Different types of clips do different things, the simplest being animating an armature-clip ( ModelClip ). You can also override the input to another ASM-clip ( TimeClip ), trigger an event while animating another clip if the input is positive ( TriggerClip ), smoothly blend between two clips ( SlerpClip ), refer to another clip in the ASM ( ClipReference ) or do nothing ( IdentityClip ). Events Various things can trigger events in the ASM. Events in the ASM are represented using only text. Some events are special, with text that is formatted like this: !event_type:event_value . Right now there is only one kind of event_type , namely transition . This tries to transition to whatever state is defined in the event_value . Anything else is a normal event and can be used from the pastEvents callback, but more information about that is on the implementing page. Code API Warning The ASM code API can only be used client side . When storing ASMs in code, use the side-agnostic IAnimationStateMachine interface. ASMs can be loaded by calling ModelLoaderRegistry.loadASM . It takes two parameters, the first being a ResourceLocation denoting where the ASM is stored, and second an ImmutableMap of load-time defined parameters. An example: @Nullable private final IAnimationStateMachine asm; private final VariableValue cycle = new VariableValue(4); public Spin() { asm = proxy.loadASM(new ResourceLocation(MODID, \"asms/block/rotatest.json\"), ImmutableMap.of(\"cycle_length\", cycle)); } Here, an ASM is loaded (from a sided proxy to avoid crashing on server) with one extra parameter, named cycle_length . This parameter is of the type VariableValue , so we can set it from within our code. Using an ASM instance, you can get the current state with .currentState() and transition to another state with .transition(nextState) VariableValue parameters can have their value set by calling .setValue , but you can not read this value back. There is no need to inform the ASM of this change, it happens automatically. File Format The ASMs are stored in json files. The location does not matter, but they are usually placed in an asms folder. First, a simple example: { \"parameters\": { \"anim_cycle\": [\"/\", \"#cycle_length\"] }, \"clips\": { \"default\": [\"apply\", \"forgedebugmodelanimation:block/rotatest@default\", \"#anim_cycle\" ] }, \"states\": [ \"default\" ], \"transitions\": {}, \"start_state\": \"default\" } As stated above, the files have parameters, clips, states and transitions, as well as the starting state of the ASM. All of these tags are required, even if they are empty. Parameters { \"name\": <parameter_definition> } Different types of parameters have different formats for <parameter_definition> , and the simple ones are: IdentityValue : the string #identity , ParameterValue : the parameter to reference, prefixed with # , e.g. #my_awesome_parameter ConstValue : a number to use as the constant to return Mathematical expression ( SimpleExprValue ) Format: [ regex(\"[+\\\\-*/mMrRfF]+\"), <parameter_definition>, ... ] Examples: [ \"+\", 4 ] [ \"/+\", 5, 1] [ \"++\", 2, \"#other\" ] [ \"++\", \"#other\", [ \"compose\", \"#cycle\", 3] ] Explanation The SimpleExprValue takes its input and applies operations to it. The first parameter is the sequence of operations to apply, and the rest represent the operands to those operations. The input to each operation is either the input to this entire parameter (for the first operation) or the result of the previous operation. Operations (case-sensitive): Operator Meaning + output = input + arg - output = input - arg * output = input * arg / output = input / arg m output = min(input, arg) M output = max(input, arg) r output = floor(input / arg) * arg R output = ceil(input / arg) * arg f output = input - floor(input / arg) * arg F output = ceil(input / arg) * arg - input Example explanations: input + 4 (input / 5) + 1 input + 2 + value of parameter other input + value of parameter other + value of parameter cycle given input 3 Function composition ( CompositionValue ) Format: [ \"compose\", <parameter_definition>, <parameter_definition> ] Examples: [ \"compose\", \"#cycle\", 3] [ \"compose\", \"#test\", \"#other\"] [ \"compose\", [ \"+\", 3], \"#other\"] [ \"compose\", [ \"compose\", \"#other2\", \"#other3\"], \"#other\"] Explanation CompositionValue takes two parameter definitions as inputs, and does value1(value2(input)) . In other words, it chains the two inputs, calling the second one with the given input, and the first one with the output of the second one. Example explanations: value of parameter cycle when given input 3 value of parameter test when given the output of parameter other when called with the current input 3 + the output of other with the current input other2(other3(other(input))) because value1 = other2(other3(input)) and value2 = other(input) Clips { \"name\": <clip_definition> } As with parameters, different kinds of clips have different formats for <clip_definition> , but the simple ones are: IdentityClip : the string #identity ClipReference : the clip name prefixed with # , e.g. #my_amazing_clip ModelClip : a model resource location + @ + the name of the armature-clip, e.g. mymod:block/test@default or mymod:block/test#facing=east@moving Overriding input ( TimeClip ) Format: [ \"apply\", <clip_definition>, <parameter_definition> ] Examples: [\"apply\", \"mymod:block/animated_thing@moving\", \"#cycle_time\"] [\"apply\", [ \"apply\", \"mymod:block/animated_thing@moving\", [ \"+\", 3 ] ], \"#cycle\"] Explanation The TimeClip takes another clip and applies it using a custom parameter instead of the current time. Usually used to apply a ModelClip with a parameter instead of the current time. Example explanations: apply the armature-clip for model mymod:block/animated_thing named moving with the output of the parameter cycle_time apply the armature-clip for model mymod:block/animated_thing named moving with 3 + the output of the parameter cycle Triggering an event ( TriggerClip ) Format: [ \"trigger_positive\", <clip_definition>, <parameter_definition>, \"<event_text>\"] Examples [ \"trigger_positive\", \"#default\", \"#end_cycle\", \"!transition:moving\" ] [ \"trigger_positive\", \"mymod:block/animated_thing@moving\", \"#end_cycle\", \"boop\" ] Explanation The TriggerClip visually acts as a TimeClip , but also fires the event in event_text when the parameter_description goes positive. At the same time, it applies the clip in clip_definition with the same parameter_description . Example explanations apply the clip with name default given the input of parameter end_cycle , and when end_cycle is positive transition to the moving state apply the armature-clip mymod:block/animated_thing@moving with parameter end_cycle , and when end_cycle is positive fire event \"boop\" Blend between two clips ( SlerpClip ) Format: [ \"slerp\", <clip_definition>, <clip_definition>, <parameter_definition>, <parameter_definition> ] Examples [ \"slerp\", \"#closed\", \"#open\", \"#identity\", \"#progress\" ] [ \"slerp\", [ \"apply\", \"#move\", \"#mover\"], \"#end\", \"#identity\", \"#progress\" ] Explanation The SlerpClip performs a spherical linear blend between two separate clips. In other words, it will morph one clip into another smoothly. The two clip_definition s are the clips to blend from and to respectively. The first parameter_definition is the \u201cinput\u201d. Both the from and to clips are passed the output of this parameter with the current animation time. The second parameter_definition is the \u201cprogress\u201d, a value between 0 and 1 to denote how far into the blend we are. Combining this clip with trigger_positive and transition special events can allow for simple transitions between two solid states. Example explanations blend the closed clip to the open clip, giving both clips the unaltered time as input and blend progress #progress . blend the result of the move clip when given the input parameter mover to the end clip with the unaltered time as the input with blend progress #progress . States The states section of the file is simply a list of all possible states. For example \"states\": [ \"open\", \"closed\", \"opening\", \"closing\", \"dancing\" ] defines 5 states: open, closed, opening, closing and dancing. Transitions The transitions section defines which states can go to what other states. A state can go to 0, 1, or many other states. To define a state as going to no other states, omit it from the section. To define a state as going to only one other state, create a key with the value of the state it can go to, for example \"open\": \"opening\" .

A more full example: \"transitions\": { \"open\": \"closing\", \"closed\": [ \"dancing\", \"opening\" ], \"closing\": \"closed\", \"opening\": \"open\", \"dancing\": \"closed\" } This example means that: the open state can go to the closing state the closed state can go to either the dancing or opening state the closing state can go to the closed state the opening state can go to the open state the dancing state can go to the closed state","title":"Asm"},{"location":"animation/asm/#animation-state-machine-files","text":"Animation State Machine (ASM) Files are the meat of the animation API.

Documentation on the ASM API itself (for controlling the animation) is found on the ASM page because it is independent of what you are animating. Blocks Animations for blocks are done with the TileEntityRendererAnimation , which is a TileEntityRenderer . Because of this, having a TileEntity for your block is necessary. Your TileEntity must provide the ANIMATION_CAPABILITY , which is received by calling its .cast method with your ASM. Your block must also render in the ENTITYBLOCK_ANIMATED render layer if you do not provide a StaticProperty in the block\u2019s blockstate. The StaticProperty is a property you can add to your block\u2019s blockstate by adding Properties.StaticProperty to the list of your block\u2019s properties inside of fillStateContainer() . When rendering the block, the TileEntityRendererAnimation checks if the property\u2019s value is true; if so, block rendering continues as normal. Otherwise the TileEntityRendererAnimation animates the block model assigned to the static=false variant in the blockstate json. All parts of the model that can be static should probably be rendered in the static state, as that is its purpose. The handleEvents() callback is located in the TileEntityRendererAnimation , so you have to either subclass or overload it inline when you register the tileentity. Here\u2019s an example of registering the TESR: ClientRegistry.bindTileEntitySpecialRenderer(Chest.class, new TileEntityRendererAnimation<Chest>() { @Override public void handleEvents(Chest chest, float time, Iterable<Event> pastEvents) { chest.handleEvents(time, pastEvents); } }); In this example, we\u2019ve overridden the handleEvents() callback when we registered the TER because the implementation is simple, but you could easily subclass TileEntityRendererAnimation to achieve the same effect. The handleEvents() callback for blocks takes two arguments: the tile entity being rendered, and an iterable of the events. The call to chest.handleEvents() calls a method located in the fictional Chest TileEntity, as the ASM is not accessible inside of the handleEvents() method. Items Animations for items are done entirely using the capability system. Your item must provide the ANIMATION_CAPABILITY through an ICapabilityProvider . You can create an instance of this capability using its .cast method with your ASM, which is usually stored on the ICapabilityProvider object itself. An example of this is below: private static class ItemAnimationHolder implements ICapabilityProvider { private final VariableValue cycleLength = new VariableValue(4); private final IAnimationStateMachine asm = proxy.load(new ResourceLocation(MODID.toLowerCase(), \"asms/block/engine.json\"), ImmutableMap.<String, ITimeValue>of( \"cycle_length\", cycleLength )); @Override public boolean hasCapability(@Nonnull Capability<?> capability, @Nullable EnumFacing facing) { return capability == CapabilityAnimation.ANIMATION_CAPABILITY; } @Override @Nullable public <T> T getCapability(@Nonnull Capability<T> capability, @Nullable EnumFacing facing) { if(capability == CapabilityAnimation.ANIMATION_CAPABILITY) { return CapabilityAnimation.ANIMATION_CAPABILITY.cast(asm); } return null; } } There is no way to receive events on an item in the current implementation. Entities In order to animate an entity with the animation API, your entity\u2019s renderer must take an AnimationModelBase as its model.

They make up all of the terrain, structures, and machines. Chances are if you are interested in making a mod, then you will want to add some blocks. This page will guide you through the creation of blocks, and some of the things you can do with them. Creating a Block Basic Blocks For simple blocks, which need no special functionality (think cobblestone, wooden planks, etc.), a custom class is not necessary. You can create a block by instantiating the Block class with a AbstractBlock$Properties object. This AbstractBlock$Properties object can be made using AbstractBlock$Properties#of , and it can be customized by calling its methods. For instance: strength - The hardness controls the time it takes to break the block. It is an arbitrary value. For reference, stone has a hardness of 1.5, and dirt 0.5. If the block should be unbreakable a hardness of -1.0 should be used, see the definition of Blocks#BEDROCK as an example. The resistance controls the explosion resistance of the block. For reference, stone has a resistance of 6.0, and dirt 0.5. sound - Controls the sound the block makes when it is punched, broken, or placed. Requires a SoundType argument, see the sounds page for more details. lightLevel - Controls the light emission of the block. Takes a function with a BlockState parameter that returns a value from zero to fifteen. friction - Controls how slippery the block is. For reference, ice has a slipperiness of 0.98. All these methods are chainable which means you can call them in series. See the Blocks class for examples of this. Note Blocks have no setter for their ItemGroup (formerly Creative Tab). This has been moved to the BlockItem and is now its responsibility. Furthermore, there is no setter for translation key as it is now generated from the registry name. Advanced Blocks Of course, the above only allows for extremely basic blocks. If you want to add functionality, like player interaction, a custom class is required. However, the Block class has many methods and unfortunately not every single one can be documented here. See the rest of the pages in this section for things you can do with blocks. Registering a Block Blocks must be registered to function. Important A block in the world and a \u201cblock\u201d in an inventory are very different things. A block in the world is represented by an BlockState , and its behavior defined by an instance of Block . Meanwhile, an item in an inventory is an ItemStack , controlled by an Item . As a bridge between the different worlds of Block and Item , there exists the class BlockItem . BlockItem is a subclass of Item that has a field block that holds a reference to the Block it represents. BlockItem defines some of the behavior of a \u201cblock\u201d as an item, like how a right click places the block. It\u2019s possible to have a Block without an BlockItem . (E.g. minecraft:water exists a block, but not an item. It is therefore impossible to hold it in an inventory as one.) When a block is registered, only a block is registered. The block does not automatically have an BlockItem . To create a basic BlockItem for a block, one should set the registry name of the BlockItem to that of its Block . Custom subclasses of BlockItem may be used as well. Once an BlockItem has been registered for a block, Block#asItem can be used to retrieve it. Block#asItem will return Items#AIR if there is no BlockItem for the Block , so if you are not certain that there is an BlockItem for the Block you are using, check for if Block#asItem returns Items#AIR . Optionally Registering Blocks In the past there have been several mods that have allowed users to disable blocks/items in a configuration file. However, you shouldn\u2019t do this. There is no limit on the amount of blocks that can be register, so register all blocks in your mod! If you want a block to be disabled through a configuration file, you should disable the crafting recipe.

BlockItem defines some of the behavior of a \u201cblock\u201d as an item, like how a right click places the block. It\u2019s possible to have a Block without an BlockItem . (E.g. minecraft:water exists a block, but not an item. It is therefore impossible to hold it in an inventory as one.) When a block is registered, only a block is registered. The block does not automatically have an BlockItem . To create a basic BlockItem for a block, one should set the registry name of the BlockItem to that of its Block . Custom subclasses of BlockItem may be used as well. Once an BlockItem has been registered for a block, Block#asItem can be used to retrieve it. Block#asItem will return Items#AIR if there is no BlockItem for the Block , so if you are not certain that there is an BlockItem for the Block you are using, check for if Block#asItem returns Items#AIR .","title":"Registering a Block"},{"location":"blocks/blocks/#optionally-registering-blocks","text":"In the past there have been several mods that have allowed users to disable blocks/items in a configuration file.

This page will cover the basics of the most common types of interaction with blocks. Player Right Click Since left clicking, or \u201cpunching\u201d, a block does not generally result in any unique behavior, it is probably fair to say right clicking, or \u201cactivation\u201d, is the most common method of interaction. And thankfully, it is also one of the simplest to handle. use public ActionResultType use(BlockState state, World worldIn, BlockPos pos, PlayerEntity player, Hand handIn, BlockRayTraceResult hit) This is the method that controls right click behavior.

Usage examples The uses for activation are literally endless. However, there are some common ones which deserve their own section. GUIs One of the most common things to do on block activation is opening a GUI. Many blocks in vanilla behave this way, such as chests, hoppers, furnaces, and many more. Activation Another common use for activation is, well, activation. This can be something like \u201cturning on\u201d a block, or triggering it to perform some action. For instance, a block could light up when activated. A vanilla example would be buttons or levers. Important use is called on both the client and the server, so be sure to keep the sidedness of your code in mind. Many things, like opening GUIs and modifying the world, should only be done on the server-side. Block Placement setPlacedBy public void setPlacedBy(World worldIn, BlockPos pos, BlockState state, @Nullable LivingEntity placer, ItemStack stack) Called by BlockItem s after a block is set in the world, to allow post-place logic. Parameters: Type Name Description World worldIn The world that the block was placed in BlockPos pos The position where the block was placed BlockState state The state of the block that was placed LivingEntity placer The entity who placed the block ItemStack stack The item block that was placed Player Break/Destroy attack public void attack(BlockState state, World worldIn, BlockPos pos, PlayerEntity player) Called on a block when it is clicked by a player.

Metadata was an extra number stored with the block, allowing different rotations, facings, or even completely separate behaviors within a block. However, the metadata system was confusing and limited, since it was stored as only a number alongside the block ID, and had no meaning except what was commented in the code. For example, to implement a block that can face a direction and be on either the upper or lower half of a block space (such as a stair): switch (meta) { case 0: { ... } // south and on the lower half of the block case 1: { ... } // south on the upper side of the block case 2: { ... } // north and on the lower half of the block case 3: { ... } // north and on the upper half of the block ... etc. ... } Because the numbers carry no meaning by themselves, no one could know what they represent unless they had access to the source code and comments. Introduction of States In Minecraft 1.8 and above, the metadata system, along with the block ID system, was deprecated and eventually replaced with the block state system . The block state system abstracts out the details of the block\u2019s properties from the other behaviors of the block. Each property of a block is described by an instance of IProperty<?> . Examples of block properties include instruments ( Property<NoteBlockInstrument> ), facing ( Property<Direction ), poweredness ( Property<Boolean> ), etc. Each property has the value of the type T parametrized by Property<T> . A unique pair can be constructed from the block and a map of the properties to their associated values. This unique pair is called a BlockState . The previous system of meaningless metadata values were replaced by a system of block properties, which are easier to interpret and deal with. Previously, a stone button which is facing east and is powered or held down is represented by \u201c minecraft:stone_button with metadata 9 . Now, this is represented by \u201c minecraft:stone_button[facing=east,powered=true] \u201d. Proper Usage of Block States The BlockState system is a flexible and powerful system, but it also has limitations. BlockState s are immutable, and all combinations of their properties are generated on startup of the game. This means that having a BlockState with many properties and possible values will slow down the loading of the game, and befuddle anyone trying to make sense of your block logic. Not all blocks and situations require the usage of BlockState ; only the most basic properties of a block should be put into a BlockState , and any other situation is better off with having a TileEntity or being a separate Block . Always consider if you actually need to use blockstates for your purposes. Note A good rule of thumb is: if it has a different name, it should be a separate block . An example is making chair blocks: the direction of the chair should be a property , while the different types of wood should be separated into different blocks. An \u201cOak Chair\u201d facing east ( oak_chair[facing=east] ) is different from a \u201cSpruce Chair\u201d facing west ( spruce_chair[facing=west] ). Implementing Block States In your Block class, create or reference static final Property<?> objects for every property that your Block has. You are free to make your own Property<?> implementations, but the means to do that are not covered in this article. The vanilla code provides several convenience implementations: IntegerProperty Implements Property<Integer> . Defines a property that holds an integer value. Created by calling IntegerProperty#create(String propertyName, int minimum, int maximum) . BooleanProperty Implements Property<Boolean> . Defines a property that holds a true or false value. Created by calling BooleanProperty#create(String propertyName) . EnumProperty<E extends Enum<E>> Implements Property<E> . Defines a property that can take on the values of an Enum class. Created by calling EnumProperty#create(String propertyName, Class<E> enumClass) . It is also possible to use only a subset of the Enum values (e.g. 4 out of 16 DyeColor s). See the overloads of EnumProperty#create . DirectionProperty This is a convenience implementation of EnumProperty<Direction> Several convenience predicates are also provided. For example, to get a property that represents the cardinal directions, call DirectionProperty.create(\"<name>\", Direction.Plane.HORIZONTAL) ; to get the X directions, DirectionProperty.create(\"<name>\", Direction.Axis.X) . The class BlockStateProperties contains shared vanilla properties which should be used or referenced whenever possible, in place of creating your own properties. When you have your desired Property<> objects, override Block#createBlockStateDefinition(StateContainer$Builder) in your Block class. In that method, call StateContainer$Builder#add(...); with the parameters as every Property<?> you wish the block to have. Every block will also have a \u201cdefault\u201d state that is automatically chosen for you. You can change this \u201cdefault\u201d state by calling the Block#registerDefaultState(BlockState) method from your constructor. When your block is placed it will become this \u201cdefault\u201d state. An example from DoorBlock : this.registerDefaultState( this.stateDefinition.any() .setValue(FACING, Direction.NORTH) .setValue(OPEN, false) .setValue(HINGE, DoorHingeSide.LEFT) .setValue(POWERED, false) .setValue(HALF, DoubleBlockHalf.LOWER) ); If you wish to change what BlockState is used when placing your block, you can overwrite Block#getStateForPlacement(BlockItemUseContext) . This can be used to, for example, set the direction of your block depending on where the player is standing when they place it. Because BlockState s are immutable, and all combinations of their properties are generated on startup of the game, calling BlockState#setValue(Property<T>, T) will simply go to the Block \u2018s StateContainer and request the BlockState with the set of values you want. Because all possible BlockState s are generated at startup, you are free and encouraged to use the reference equality operator ( == ) to check if two BlockState s are equal. Using BlockState \u2018s You can get the value of a property by calling BlockState#getValue(Property<?>) , passing it the property you want to get the value of. If you want to get a BlockState with a different set of values, simply call BlockState#setValue(Property<T>, T) with the property and its value. You can get and place BlockState \u2018s in the world using World#setBlockAndUpdate(BlockPos, BlockState) and World#getBlockState(BlockState) . If you are placing a Block , call Block#defaultBlockState() to get the \u201cdefault\u201d state, and use subsequent calls to BlockState#setValue(Property<T>, T) as stated above to achieve the desired state.","title":"Blockstates"},{"location":"blocks/states/#block-states","text":"","title":"Block States"},{"location":"blocks/states/#legacy-behavior","text":"In Minecraft 1.7 and previous versions, blocks which need to store placement or state data that did not have TileEntities used metadata .

Localization is the process of adapting displayed text to the user\u2019s language. I18n is implemented using translation keys . A translation key is a string that identifies a piece of displayable text in no specific language. For example, block.minecraft.dirt is the translation key referring to the name of the Dirt block. This way, displayable text may be referenced with no concern for a specific language. The code requires no changes to be adapted in a new language. Localization will happen in the game\u2019s locale. In a Minecraft client the locale is specified by the language settings. On a dedicated server, the only supported locale is en_us . A list of available locales can be found on the Minecraft Wiki . Language files Language files are located by assets/[namespace]/lang/[locale].json (e.g. all US English translations provided by examplemod would be within assets/examplemod/lang/en_us.json ). The file format is simply a json map from translation keys to values. The file must be encoded in UTF-8. Old .lang files can be converted to json using a converter . { \"item.examplemod.example_item\": \"Example Item Name\", \"block.examplemod.example_block\": \"Example Block Name\", \"commands.examplemod.examplecommand.error\": \"Example Command Errored!\" } Usage with Blocks and Items Block, Item and a few other Minecraft classes have built-in translation keys used to display their names. These translation keys are specified by overriding #getDescriptionId . Item also has #getDescriptionId(ItemStack) which can be overridden to provide different translation keys depending on ItemStack NBT. By default, #getDescriptionId will return block. or item. prepended to the registry name of the block or item, with the colon replaced by a dot. BlockItem s override this method to take their corresponding Block \u2018s translation key by default. For example, an item with ID examplemod:example_item effectively requires the following line in a language file: { \"item.examplemod.example_item\": \"Example Item Name\" } Note The only purpose of a translation key is internationalization. Do not use them for logic. Use registry names instead. Localization methods Warning A common issue is having the server localize for clients. The server can only localize in its own locale, which does not necessarily match the locale of connected clients. To respect the language settings of clients, the server should have clients localize text in their own locale using TranslationTextComponent or other methods preserving the language neutral translation keys. net.minecraft.client.resources.I18n (client only) This I18n class can only be found on a Minecraft client! It is intended to be used by code that only runs on the client. Attempts to use this on a server will throw exceptions and crash. get(String, Object...) localizes in the client\u2019s locale with formatting. The first parameter is a translation key, and the rest are formatting arguments for String.format(String, Object...) . TranslationTextComponent TranslationTextComponent is an ITextComponent that is localized and formatted lazily. It is very useful when sending messages to players because it will be automatically localized in their own locale. The first parameter of the TranslationTextComponent(String, Object...) constructor is a translation key, and the rest are used for formatting. The only supported format specifiers are %s and %1$s , %2$s , %3$s etc. Formatting arguments may be other ITextComponent s that will be inserted into the resulting formatted text with all their attributes preserved.

Registering things is important, as without registration the game will simply not know about these objects, which will cause unexplainable behaviors and crashes. Most things that require registration in the game are handled by the Forge registries. A registry is an object similar to a map that assigns values to keys. Forge uses registries with ResourceLocation keys to register objects. This allows the ResourceLocation to act as the \u201cregistry name\u201d for objects. The registry name for an object may be accessed with #getRegistryName / #setRegistryName . The setter can only be called once; calling it twice results in an exception. Every type of registrable object has its own registry. To see all registries supported by Forge, see the ForgeRegistries class. All registry names within a registry must be unique. However, names in different registries will not collide. For example, there\u2019s a Block registry, and an Item registry. A Block and an Item may be registered with the same name example:thing without colliding; however, if two different Block s or Item s were registered with the same exact name, the second object will override the first. Methods for Registering There are two proper ways to register objects: the DeferredRegister class, and the RegistryEvent$Register lifecycle event. DeferredRegister DeferredRegister is the newer and documented way to register objects. It allows the use and convenience of static initializers while avoiding the issues associated with it. It simply maintains a list of suppliers for entries and registers the objects from those suppliers during the proper RegistryEvent$Register event. An example of a mod registering a custom block: private static final DeferredRegister<Block> BLOCKS = DeferredRegister.create(ForgeRegistries.BLOCKS, MODID); public static final RegistryObject<Block> ROCK_BLOCK = BLOCKS.register(\"rock\", () -> new Block(AbstractBlock.Properties.of(Material.STONE))); public ExampleMod() { BLOCKS.register(FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus()); } Register events The RegistryEvent s are the second and more flexible way to register objects. These events are fired after the mod constructors and before the loading of configs. The event used to register objects is RegistryEvent$Register<T> . The type parameter T should be set to the type of the object being registered. Calling #getRegistry will return the registry, upon which objects are registered with #register or #registerAll . Here is an example: (the event handler is registered on the mod event bus ) @SubscribeEvent public void registerBlocks(RegistryEvent.Register<Block> event) { event.getRegistry().registerAll(new Block(...), new Block(...), ...); } Registries that aren\u2019t Forge Registries Due to some peculiarities of vanilla code, not all registries are wrapped by Forge. These can be static registries, like IRecipeType , which are safe to use. There are also dynamic registries, like ConfiguredFeature and some other worldgen registries, which are typically represented in JSON. These objects should only be registered this way if there is another registry object that requires it. Without the benefit of registry objects, care has to be taken to not register things before they\u2019re ready. Lazy is a utility class that stores a value that is calculated the first time it is accessed. Using Lazy.of(...) with a supplier as a parameter is its typical usage. Lazy is a subclass of Supplier , so Supplier#get is used to retrieve the value. In this case, the value to be stored is () -> Registry.register(...) . For parameters, Registry#register takes the registry being added to, a ResourceLocation identifying the object to be registered, and the object itself. The appropriate time to populate these objects is in FMLCommonSetupEvent . Because vanilla registries are not guaranteed to be threadsafe, a call to Supplier#get should be inside a ParallelDispatchEvent#enqueueWork call. This evaluates the Registry#register call, which will register the object and allow it to be referenced freely. Note Some classes cannot by themselves be registered. Instead, *Type classes are registered, and used in the formers\u2019 constructors. For example, TileEntity has TileEntityType , and Entity has EntityType . These *Type classes are factories that simply create the containing type on demand. These factories are created through the use of their *Type$Builder classes. An example: ( REGISTER refers to a DeferredRegister<TileEntityType> ) public static final RegistryObject<TileEntityType<ExampleTile>> EXAMPLE_TILE = REGISTER.register( \"example_tile\", () -> TileEntityType.Builder.of(ExampleTile::new, EXAMPLE_BLOCK.get()).build(null) ); Referencing Registered Objects Registered objects should not be stored in fields when they are created and registered. They are to be always newly created and registered whenever their respective RegistryEvent$Register event is fired. This is to allow dynamic loading and unloading of mods in a future version of Forge. Registered objects must always be referenced through a RegistryObject or a field with @ObjectHolder . Using RegistryObjects RegistryObject s can be used to retrieve references to registered objects once they are available. These are used by DeferredRegister to return a reference to the registered objects. Their references are updated after their corresponding registry\u2019s RegistryEvent$Register event is fired, along with the @ObjectHolder annotations. To get a RegistryObject , call RegistryObject#of with a ResourceLocation and the IForgeRegistry of the registrable object. Custom registries can also be used by giving a supplier of the object\u2019s class. Store the RegistryObject in a public static final field, and call #get whenever you need the registered object. An example of using RegistryObject : public static final RegistryObject<Item> BOW = RegistryObject.of(new ResourceLocation(\"minecraft:bow\"), ForgeRegistries.ITEMS); // assume that ManaType is a valid registry, and 'neomagicae:coffeinum' is a valid object within that registry public static final RegistryObject<ManaType> COFFEINUM = RegistryObject.of(new ResourceLocation(\"neomagicae\", \"coffeinum\"), () -> ManaType.class); Using @ObjectHolder Registered objects from registries can be injected into the public static fields by annotating classes or fields with @ObjectHolder and supplying enough information to construct a ResourceLocation to identify a specific object in a specific registry. The rules for @ObjectHolder are as follows: If the class is annotated with @ObjectHolder , its value will be the default namespace for all fields within if not explicitly defined If the class is annotated with @Mod , the modid will be the default namespace for all annotated fields within if not explicitly defined A field is considered for injection if: it has at least the modifiers public static ; one of the following conditions are true: the enclosing class has an @ObjectHolder annotation, and the field is final , and: the name value is the field\u2019s name; and the namespace value is the enclosing class\u2019s namespace An exception is thrown if the namespace value cannot be found and inherited the field is annotated with @ObjectHolder , and: the name value is explicitly defined; and the namespace value is either explicitly defined or the enclosing class\u2019s namespace the field type or one of its supertypes corresponds to a valid registry (e.g. Item or ArrowItem for the Item registry); An exception is thrown if a field does not have a corresponding registry. An exception is thrown if the resulting ResourceLocation is incomplete or invalid (non-valid characters in path) If no other errors or exceptions occur, the field will be injected If all of the above rules do not apply, no action will be taken (and a message may be logged) @ObjectHolder -annotated fields are injected with their values after their corresponding registry\u2019s RegistryEvent$Register event is fired, along with the RegistryObject s. Note If the object does not exist in the registry when it is to be injected, a debug message will be logged and no value will be injected. As these rules are rather complicated, here are some examples: @ObjectHolder(\"minecraft\") // Inheritable resource namespace: \"minecraft\" class AnnotatedHolder { public static final Block diamond_block = null; // No annotation. [public static final] is required. // Block has a corresponding registry: [Block] // Name path is the name of the field: \"diamond_block\" // Namespace is not explicitly defined. // So, namespace is inherited from class annotation: \"minecraft\" // To inject: \"minecraft:diamond_block\" from the [Block] registry @ObjectHolder(\"ambient.cave\") public static SoundEvent ambient_sound = null; // Annotation present. [public static] is required. // SoundEvent has a corresponding registry: [SoundEvent] // Name path is the value of the annotation: \"ambient.cave\" // Namespace is not explicitly defined. // So, namespace is inherited from class annotation: \"minecraft\" // To inject: \"minecraft:ambient.cave\" from the [SoundEvent] registry // Assume for the next entry that [ManaType] is a valid registry. @ObjectHolder(\"neomagicae:coffeinum\") public static final ManaType coffeinum = null; // Annotation present. [public static] is required. [final] is optional. // ManaType has a corresponding registry: [ManaType] (custom registry) // Resource location is explicitly defined: \"neomagicae:coffeinum\" // To inject: \"neomagicae:coffeinum\" from the [ManaType] registry public static final Item ENDER_PEARL = null; // No annotation. [public static final] is required. // Item has a corresponding registry: [Item]. // Name path is the name of the field: \"ENDER_PEARL\" -> \"ender_pearl\" // !! ^ Field name is valid, because they are // converted to lowercase automatically. // Namespace is not explicitly defined. // So, namespace is inherited from class annotation: \"minecraft\" // To inject: \"minecraft:ender_pearl\" from the [Item] registry @ObjectHolder(\"minecraft:arrow\") public static final ArrowItem arrow = null; // Annotation present. [public static] is required. [final] is optional. // ArrowItem does not have a corresponding registry. // ArrowItem's supertype of Item has a corresponding registry: [Item] // Resource location is explicitly defined: \"minecraft:arrow\" // To inject: \"minecraft:arrow\" from the [Item] registry public static Block bedrock = null; // No annotation, so [public static final] is required. // Therefore, the field is ignored. public static final ItemGroup group = null; // No annotation. [public static final] is required. // ItemGroup does not have a corresponding registry. // No supertypes of ItemGroup has a corresponding registry. // Therefore, THIS WILL PRODUCE AN EXCEPTION. } class UnannotatedHolder { // Note the lack of an @ObjectHolder annotation on this class. @ObjectHolder(\"minecraft:flame\") public static final Enchantment flame = null; // Annotation present. [public static] is required. [final] is optional. // Enchantment has corresponding registry: [Enchantment]. // Resource location is explicitly defined: \"minecraft:flame\" // To inject: \"minecraft:flame\" from the [Enchantment] registry public static final Biome ice_flat = null; // No annotation on the enclosing class. // Therefore, the field is ignored. @ObjectHolder(\"minecraft:creeper\") public static Entity creeper = null; // Annotation present. [public static] is required. // Entity does not have a corresponding registry. // No supertypes of Entity has a corresponding registry. // Therefore, THIS WILL PRODUCE AN EXCEPTION. @ObjectHolder(\"levitation\") public static final Potion levitation = null; // Annotation present. [public static] is required. [final] is optional. // Potion has a corresponding registry: [Potion]. // Name path is the value of the annotation: \"levitation\" // Namespace is not explicitly defined. // No annotation in enclosing class. // Therefore, THIS WILL PRODUCE AN EXCEPTION. } Creating Custom Forge Registries Custom registries can usually just be a simple map of key to value. This is a common style; however, it forces a hard dependency on the registry being present. It also requires that any data that needs to be synced between sides must be done manually. Custom Forge Registries provide a simple alternative for creating soft dependents along with better management and automatic syncing between sides (unless told otherwise). Since the objects also use a Forge registry, registration becomes standardized in the same way. Custom Forge Registries are created via RegistryBuilder via either RegistryEvent$NewRegistry or the DeferredRegister . The class RegistryBuilder takes certain parameters (such as the name, the Class of its values, and various callbacks for different events happening on the registry). Calling RegistryBuilder#create will result in the registry being built, registered to the RegistryManager , and returned to the caller for additional processing. The Class of the value of the registry must implement IForgeRegistryEntry , which defines that #setRegistryName and #getRegistryName can be called on the objects of that class. It is recommended to extend ForgeRegistryEntry , the default implementation instead of implementing the interface directly. When #setRegistryName(String) is called with a string, and that string does not have an explicit namespace, its namespace will be set to the current modid. Any newly created registry should use its associated registration method to register the associated objects. Using RegistryEvent$NewRegistry When using RegistryEvent$NewRegistry , all one needs to do is construct the registry within the event via RegistryBuilder . Since the registry is created after calling #create , the resulting registry can be stored in any IForgeRegistry field for future use. With DeferredRegister The DeferredRegister method is once again another wrapper around the above event. Once a DeferredRegister is created in a constant field, the registry can be constructed via DeferredRegister#makeRegistry . This takes in the name of the registry along with a supplied RegistryBuilder containing any additional configurations. The method already populates #setName and #setType by default. Since this method can be returned at any time, a supplied version of an IForgeRegistry is returned instead. This will be unresolvable until RegistryEvent$NewRegistry passes. Important DeferredRegister#makeRegistry must be called before the DeferredRegister is added to the mod event bus via #register . #makeRegistry also uses the #register method to create the registry during RegistryEvent$NewRegistry . Handling Missing Entries There are cases where certain registry objects will cease to exist whenever a mod is updated or, more likely, removed. It is possible to specify actions to handle the missing mapping through the third of the registry events: RegistryEvent$MissingMappings . Within this event, a list of missing mappings can be obtained either by #getMappings given a mod id or all mappings via #getAllMappings . For each Mapping , one of four mapping types can be selected to handle the missing entry: Action Description IGNORE Ignores the missing entry and abandons the mapping. WARN Generates a warning in the log. FAIL Prevents the world from loading. REMAP Remaps the entry to an already registered, non-null object. If no action is specified, then the default action will occur by notifying the user about the missing entry and whether they still would like to load the world. All actions besides remapping will prevent any other registry object from taking the place of the existing id in case the associated entry ever gets added back into the game.","title":"Registries"},{"location":"concepts/registries/#registries","text":"Registration is the process of taking the objects of a mod (such as items, blocks, sounds, etc.) and making them known to the game.

Custom Forge Registries provide a simple alternative for creating soft dependents along with better management and automatic syncing between sides (unless told otherwise). Since the objects also use a Forge registry, registration becomes standardized in the same way. Custom Forge Registries are created via RegistryBuilder via either RegistryEvent$NewRegistry or the DeferredRegister . The class RegistryBuilder takes certain parameters (such as the name, the Class of its values, and various callbacks for different events happening on the registry). Calling RegistryBuilder#create will result in the registry being built, registered to the RegistryManager , and returned to the caller for additional processing. The Class of the value of the registry must implement IForgeRegistryEntry , which defines that #setRegistryName and #getRegistryName can be called on the objects of that class. It is recommended to extend ForgeRegistryEntry , the default implementation instead of implementing the interface directly.

There are many, many common misconceptions and mistakes regarding siding, which can lead to bugs that might not crash the game, but can rather have unintended and often unpredictable effects. Different Kinds of Sides When we say \u201cclient\u201d or \u201cserver\u201d, it usually follows with a fairly intuitive understanding of what part of the game we are talking about. After all, a client is what the user interacts with, and a server is where the user connects for a multiplayer game. Easy, right? As it turns out, there can be some ambiguity even with two such terms. Here we disambiguate the four possible meanings of \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d: Physical client - The physical client is the entire program that runs whenever you launch Minecraft from the launcher. All threads, processes, and services that run during the game\u2019s graphical, interactable lifetime are part of the physical client. Physical server - Often known as the dedicated server, the physical server is the entire program that runs whenever you launch any sort of minecraft_server.jar that does not bring up a playable GUI. Logical server - The logical server is what runs game logic: mob spawning, weather, updating inventories, health, AI, and all other game mechanics. The logical server is present within a physical server, but it also can run inside a physical client together with a logical client, as a single player world. The logical server always runs in a thread named the Server Thread . Logical client - The logical client is what accepts input from the player and relays it to the logical server. In addition, it also receives information from the logical server and makes it available graphically to the player. The logical client runs in the Client Thread , though often several other threads are spawned to handle things like audio and chunk render batching. In the MinecraftForge codebase, the physical side is represented by an enum called Dist , while the logical side is represented by an enum called LogicalSide . Performing Side-Specific Operations World#isClientSide This boolean check will be your most used way to check sides. Querying this field on a World object establishes the logical side the world belongs to. That is, if this field is true , the world is currently running on the logical client. If the field is false , the world is running on the logical server. It follows that the physical server will always contain false in this field, but we cannot assume that false implies a physical server, since this field can also be false for the logical server inside a physical client (in other words, a single player world). Use this check whenever you need to determine if game logic and other mechanics should be run. For example, if you want to damage the player every time they click your block, or have your machine process dirt into diamonds, you should only do so after ensuring #isClientSide is false . Applying game logic to the logical client can cause desynchronization (ghost entities, desynchronized stats, etc.) in the best case, and crashes in the worst case. This check should be used as your go-to default. Aside from DistExecutor , rarely will you need the other ways of determining side and adjusting behavior. DistExecutor Considering the use of a single \u201cuniversal\u201d jar for client and server mods, and the separation of the physical sides into two jars, an important question comes to mind: How do we use code that is only present on one physical side? All code in net.minecraft.client is only present on the physical client. If any class you write references those names in any way, they will crash the game when that respective class is loaded in an environment where those names do not exist. A very common mistake in beginners is to call Minecraft.getInstance().<doStuff>() in block or tile entity classes, which will crash any physical server as soon as the class is loaded. How do we resolve this? Luckily, FML has DistExecutor , which provides various methods to run different methods on different physical sides, or a single method only on one side. Note It is important to understand that FML checks based on the physical side. A single player world (logical server + logical client within a physical client) will always use Dist.CLIENT ! DistExecutor works by taking in a supplied supplier executing a method, effectively preventing classloading by taking advantage of the invokedynamic JVM instruction . The executed method should be static and within a different class. Additionally, if no parameters are present for the static method, a method reference should be used instead of a supplier executing a method. There are two main methods within DistExecutor : #runWhenOn and #callWhenOn . The methods take in the physical side the executing method should run on and the supplied executing method which either runs or returns a result respectively. These two methods are subdivided further into #safe* and #unsafe* variants. Safe and unsafe variants are misnomers for their purposes. The main difference is that when in a development environment, the #safe* methods will validate that the supplied executing method is a lambda returning a method reference to another class with an error being thrown otherwise. Within the production environment, #safe* and #unsafe* are functionally the same. // In a client class: ExampleClass public static void unsafeRunMethodExample(Object param1, Object param2) { // ... } public static Object safeCallMethodExample() { // ... } // In some common class DistExecutor.unsafeRunWhenOn(Dist.CLIENT, () -> ExampleClass.unsafeRunMethodExample(var1, var2)); DistExecutor.safeCallWhenOn(Dist.CLIENT, () -> ExampleClass::safeCallMethodExample); Thread Groups If Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup() == SidedThreadGroups.SERVER is true, it is likely the current thread is on the logical server. Otherwise, it is likely on the logical client. This is useful to retrieve the logical side when you do not have access to a World object to check isClientSide . It guesses which logical side you are on by looking at the group of the currently running thread. Because it is a guess, this method should only be used when other options have been exhausted. In nearly every case, you should prefer checking World#isClientSide . FMLEnvironment#dist and @OnlyIn FMLEnvironment#dist holds the physical side your code is running on. Since it is determined at startup, it does not rely on guessing to return its result. The number of use cases for this is limited, however. Annotating a method or field with the @OnlyIn(Dist) annotation indicates to the loader that the respective member should be completely stripped out of the definition not on the specified physical side. Usually, these are only seen when browsing through the decompiled Minecraft code, indicating methods that the Mojang obfuscator stripped out. There is NO reason for using this annotation directly. Use DistExecutor or a check on FMLEnvironment#dist instead. Common Mistakes Reaching Across Logical Sides Whenever you want to send information from one logical side to another, you must always use network packets. It is incredibly tempting, when in a single player scenario, to directly transfer data from the logical server to the logical client. This is actually very commonly inadvertently done through static fields. Since the logical client and logical server share the same JVM in a single player scenario, both threads writing to and reading from static fields will cause all sorts of race conditions and the classical issues associated with threading. This mistake can also be made explicitly by accessing physical client-only classes such as Minecraft from common code that runs or can run on the logical server. This mistake is easy to miss for beginners who debug in a physical client. The code will work there, but it will immediately crash on a physical server. Writing One-Sided Mods In recent versions, Minecraft Forge has removed a \u201csidedness\u201d attribute from the mods.toml. This means that your mods are expected to work whether they are loaded on the physical client or the physical server. So for one-sided mods, you would typically register your event handlers inside a DistExecutor#safeRunWhenOn or DistExecutor#unsafeRunWhenOn instead of directly calling the relevant registration methods in your mod constructor. Basically, if your mod is loaded on the wrong side, it should simply do nothing, listen to no events, and so on. A one-sided mod by nature should not register blocks, items, \u2026 since they would need to be available on the other side, too. Additionally, if your mod is one-sided, it typically does not forbid the user from joining a server that is lacking that mod. Therefore, you should override the DISPLAYTEST extension point to make sure that Forge does not think your mod is required on the server, which would lead to the server being shown as incompatible. For that, put something similar to this into your main mod class constructor: //Make sure the mod being absent on the other network side does not cause the client to display the server as incompatible ModLoadingContext.get().registerExtensionPoint(ExtensionPoint.DISPLAYTEST, () -> Pair.of(() -> FMLNetworkConstants.IGNORESERVERONLY, (a, b) -> true)); This tells the client that it should ignore the server version being absent, and the server that it should not tell the client this mod should be present. So this snippet works both for client- and server-only-sided mods.","title":"Sides"},{"location":"concepts/sides/#sides-in-minecraft","text":"A very important concept to understand when modding Minecraft are the two sides: client and server .

In general terms, each capability provides a feature in the form of an interface, a default implementation which can be requested, and a storage handler for at least this default implementation. The storage handler can support other implementations, but this is up to the capability implementor, so look it up in their documentation before trying to use the default storage with non-default implementations. Forge adds capability support to TileEntities, Entities, ItemStacks, Worlds, and Chunks, which can be exposed either by attaching them through an event or by overriding the capability methods in your own implementations of the objects. This will be explained in more detail in the following sections. Forge-provided Capabilities Forge provides three capabilities: IItemHandler , IFluidHandler and IEnergyStorage IItemHandler exposes an interface for handling inventory slots. It can be applied to TileEntities (chests, machines, etc.), Entities (extra player slots, mob/creature inventories/bags), or ItemStacks (portable backpacks and such). It replaces the old IInventory and ISidedInventory with an automation-friendly system. IFluidHandler exposes an interface for handling fluid inventories. It can also be applied to TileEntities, Entities, or ItemStacks. It replaces the old IFluidHandler with a more consistent and automation-friendly system. IEnergyStorage exposes an interface for handling energy containers. It can be applied to TileEntities, Entities, or ItemStacks. It is based on the RedstoneFlux API by TeamCoFH. Using an Existing Capability As mentioned earlier, TileEntities, Entities, and ItemStacks implement the capability provider feature through the ICapabilityProvider interface. This interface adds the method #getCapability , which can be used to query the capabilities present in the associated provider objects. In order to obtain a capability, you will need to refer it by its unique instance. In the case of the IItemHandler , this capability is primarily stored in CapabilityItemHandler#ITEM_HANDLER_CAPABILITY , but it is possible to get other instance references by using the @CapabilityInject annotation. @CapabilityInject(IItemHandler.class) static Capability<IItemHandler> ITEM_HANDLER_CAPABILITY = null; This annotation can be applied to fields and methods. When applied to a field, it will assign the instance of the capability (the same one gets assigned to all fields) upon registration of the capability and left to the existing value ( null ) if the capability was never registered. Because local static field accesses are fast, it is a good idea to keep your own local copy of the reference for objects that work with capabilities. This annotation can also be used on a method, in order to get notified when a capability is registered, so that certain features can be enabled conditionally. The #getCapability method has a second parameter, of type Direction , which can be used to request the specific instance for that one face. If passed null , it can be assumed that the request comes either from within the block or from some place where the side has no meaning, such as a different dimension. In this case a general capability instance that does not care about sides will be requested instead. The return type of #getCapability will correspond to a LazyOptional of the type declared in the capability passed to the method. For the Item Handler capability, this is LazyOptional<IItemHandler> . If the capability is not available for a particular provider, it will return an empty LazyOptional instead. Exposing a Capability In order to expose a capability, you will first need an instance of the underlying capability type. Note that you should assign a separate instance to each object that keeps the capability, since the capability will most probably be tied to the containing object. There are two ways to obtain such an instance: through the Capability itself or by explicitly instantiating an implementation of it. The first method is designed to use a default implementation via Capability#getDefaultInstance , if those default values are useful for you. In the case of the Item Handler capability, the default implementation will expose a single slot inventory, which is most probably not what you want. The second method can be used to provide custom implementations. In the case of IItemHandler , the default implementation uses the ItemStackHandler class, which has an optional argument in the constructor, to specify a number of slots. However, relying on the existence of these default implementations should be avoided, as the purpose of the capability system is to prevent loading errors in contexts where the capability is not present, so instantiation should be protected behind a check testing if the capability has been registered (see the remarks about @CapabilityInject in the previous section). Once you have your own instance of the capability interface, you will want to notify users of the capability system that you expose this capability and provide a LazyOptional of the interface reference. This is done by overriding the #getCapability method, and comparing the capability instance with the capability you are exposing. If your machine has different slots based on which side is being queried, you can test this with the side parameter. For Entities and ItemStacks, this parameter can be ignored, but it is still possible to have side as a context, such as different armor slots on a player ( Direction#UP exposing the player\u2019s helmet slot), or about the surrounding blocks in the inventory ( Direction#WEST exposing the input slot of a furnace). Do not forget to fall back to super , otherwise existing attached capabilities will stop working. Capabilities must be invalidated at the end of the provider\u2019s lifecycle via LazyOptional#invalidate . For owned TileEntities and Entities, the LazyOptional can be invalidated within #invalidateCaps . For non-owned providers, a runnable supplying the invalidation should be passed into AttachCapabilitiesEvent#addListener . // Somewhere in your TileEntity subclass LazyOptional<IItemHandler> inventoryHandlerLazyOptional; // Supplied instance (e.g. () -> inventoryHandler) // Ensure laziness as initialization should only happen when needed inventoryHandlerLazyOptional = LazyOptional.of(inventoryHandlerSupplier); @Override public <T> LazyOptional<T> getCapability(Capability<T> cap, Direction side) { if (cap == CapabilityItemHandler.ITEM_HANDLER_CAPABILITY) { return inventoryHandlerLazyOptional.cast(); } return super.getCapability(cap, side); } @Override public void invalidateCaps() { super.invalidateCaps(); inventoryHandlerLazyOptional.invalidate(); } Item s are a special case since their capability providers are stored on an ItemStack . Instead, a provider should be attached through Item#initCapabilities . This should hold your capabilities for the lifecycle of the stack. It is strongly suggested that direct checks in code are used to test for capabilities instead of attempting to rely on maps or other data structures, since capability tests can be done by many objects every tick, and they need to be as fast as possible in order to avoid slowing down the game. Attaching Capabilities As mentioned, attaching capabilities to existing providers, World s, and Chunk s can be done using AttachCapabilitiesEvent . The same event is used for all objects that can provide capabilities. AttachCapabilitiesEvent has 5 valid generic types providing the following events: AttachCapabilitiesEvent<Entity> : Fires only for entities. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<TileEntity> : Fires only for tile entities. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<ItemStack> : Fires only for item stacks. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<World> : Fires only for worlds. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<Chunk> : Fires only for chunks. The generic type cannot be more specific than the above types. For example: If you want to attach capabilities to PlayerEntity , you have to subscribe to the AttachCapabilitiesEvent<Entity> , and then determine that the provided object is an PlayerEntity before attaching the capability. In all cases, the event has a method #addCapability which can be used to attach capabilities to the target object. Instead of adding capabilities themselves to the list, you add capability providers, which have the chance to return capabilities only from certain sides. While the provider only needs to implement ICapabilityProvider , if the capability needs to store data persistently, it is possible to implement ICapabilitySerializable<T extends INBT> which, on top of returning the capabilities, will provide NBT save/load functions. For information on how to implement ICapabilityProvider , refer to the Exposing a Capability section. Creating Your Own Capability In general terms, a capability is declared and registered through a single method call to CapabilityManager.INSTANCE.register(...) . One possibility is to define a static register() method inside a dedicated class for the capability, but this is not required by the capability system. For the purpose of this documentation, we will be describing each part as a separate named class, although anonymous classes are an option. CapabilityManager.INSTANCE.register(<capability interface class>, <storage>, <default implementation factory>); The first parameter to this method is the type that describes the capability feature. In our example, this will be IExampleCapability.class . The second parameter is an instance of a class that implements Capability$IStorage<T> , where T is the same class we specified in the first parameter. This storage class will help manage saving and loading for the default implementation, and it can, optionally, also support other implementations. This is just a helper and does not save or load data without being called within ICapabilitySerializable . private static class Storage implements Capability.IStorage<IExampleCapability> { @Override public INBT writeNBT(Capability<IExampleCapability> capability, IExampleCapability instance, Direction side) { // return an NBT tag } @Override public void readNBT(Capability<IExampleCapability> capability, IExampleCapability instance, Direction side, INBT nbt) { // load from the NBT tag } } The last parameter is a callable factory that will return new instances of the default implementation. private static class Factory implements Callable<IExampleCapability> { @Override public IExampleCapability call() throws Exception { return new Implementation(); } } Finally, we will need the default implementation itself, to be able to instantiate it in the factory. Designing this class is up to you, but it should at least provide a basic skeleton that people can use to test the capability, if it is not a fully usable implementation itself. Persisting Chunk and TileEntity capabilities Unlike Worlds, Entities, and ItemStacks, Chunks and TileEntities are only written to disk when they have been marked as dirty. A capability implementation with persistent state for a Chunk or a TileEntity should therefore ensure that whenever its state changes, its owner is marked as dirty. ItemStackHandler , commonly used for inventories in TileEntities, has an overridable method void onContentsChanged(int slot) designed to be used to mark the TileEntity as dirty. public class MyTileEntity extends TileEntity { private final IItemHandler inventory = new ItemStackHandler(...) { @Override protected void onContentsChanged(int slot) { super.onContentsChanged(slot); setChanged(); } } ... } Synchronizing Data with Clients By default, capability data is not sent to clients. In order to change this, the mods have to manage their own synchronization code using packets. There are three different situations in which you may want to send synchronization packets, all of them optional: When the entity spawns in the world, or the block is placed, you may want to share the initialization-assigned values with the clients. When the stored data changes, you may want to notify some or all of the watching clients. When a new client starts viewing the entity or block, you may want to notify it of the existing data. Refer to the Networking page for more information on implementing network packets. Persisting across Player Deaths By default, the capability data does not persist on death. In order to change this, the data has to be manually copied when the player entity is cloned during the respawn process. This can be done via PlayerEvent$Clone by reading the data from the original entity and assigning it to the new entity. In this event, the wasDead field can be used to distinguish between respawning after death and returning from the End. This is important because the data will already exist when returning from the End, so care has to be taken to not duplicate values in this case. Migrating from IExtendedEntityProperties Although the Capability system can do everything IEEPs (IExtendedEntityProperties) did and more, the two concepts don\u2019t fully match 1:1. This section will explain how to convert existing IEEPs into Capabilities. This is a quick list of IEEP concepts and their Capability equivalent: Property name/id ( String ): Capability key ( ResourceLocation ) Registration ( EntityConstructing ): Attaching ( AttachCapabilitiesEvent<Entity> ), the real registration of the Capability happens during FMLCommonSetupEvent . NBT read/write methods: Does not happen automatically. Attach an ICapabilitySerializable in the event and run the read/write methods from the serializeNBT / deserializeNBT . Features you probably will not need (if the IEEP was for internal use only): The Capability system provides a default implementation concept, meant to simplify usage by third party consumers, but it doesn\u2019t really make much sense for an internal Capability designed to replace an IEEP. You can safely return null from the factory if the capability is for internal use only. The Capability system provides an IStorage system that can be used as a helper to read/write data from those default implementations. The following steps assume you have read the rest of the document and you understand the concepts of the capability system. Quick conversion guide: Convert the IEEP key/id string into a ResourceLocation (which will use your MODID as a namespace). In your handler class (not the class that implements your capability interface), create a field that will hold the Capability instance. Change the EntityConstructing event to AttachCapabilitiesEvent , and instead of querying the IEEP, you will want to attach an ICapabilityProvider (probably ICapabilitySerializable , which allows saving/loading from NBT). Create a registration method if you don\u2019t have one (you may have one where you registered your IEEP\u2019s event handlers) and in it, run the capability registration function.","title":"Capabilities"},{"location":"datastorage/capabilities/#the-capability-system","text":"Capabilities allow exposing features in a dynamic and flexible way without having to resort to directly implementing many interfaces. In general terms, each capability provides a feature in the form of an interface, a default implementation which can be requested, and a storage handler for at least this default implementation. The storage handler can support other implementations, but this is up to the capability implementor, so look it up in their documentation before trying to use the default storage with non-default implementations. Forge adds capability support to TileEntities, Entities, ItemStacks, Worlds, and Chunks, which can be exposed either by attaching them through an event or by overriding the capability methods in your own implementations of the objects. This will be explained in more detail in the following sections.","title":"The Capability System"},{"location":"datastorage/capabilities/#forge-provided-capabilities","text":"Forge provides three capabilities: IItemHandler , IFluidHandler and IEnergyStorage IItemHandler exposes an interface for handling inventory slots. It can be applied to TileEntities (chests, machines, etc.), Entities (extra player slots, mob/creature inventories/bags), or ItemStacks (portable backpacks and such). It replaces the old IInventory and ISidedInventory with an automation-friendly system. IFluidHandler exposes an interface for handling fluid inventories. It can also be applied to TileEntities, Entities, or ItemStacks. It replaces the old IFluidHandler with a more consistent and automation-friendly system. IEnergyStorage exposes an interface for handling energy containers. It can be applied to TileEntities, Entities, or ItemStacks.

This interface adds the method #getCapability , which can be used to query the capabilities present in the associated provider objects. In order to obtain a capability, you will need to refer it by its unique instance. In the case of the IItemHandler , this capability is primarily stored in CapabilityItemHandler#ITEM_HANDLER_CAPABILITY , but it is possible to get other instance references by using the @CapabilityInject annotation. @CapabilityInject(IItemHandler.class) static Capability<IItemHandler> ITEM_HANDLER_CAPABILITY = null; This annotation can be applied to fields and methods. When applied to a field, it will assign the instance of the capability (the same one gets assigned to all fields) upon registration of the capability and left to the existing value ( null ) if the capability was never registered. Because local static field accesses are fast, it is a good idea to keep your own local copy of the reference for objects that work with capabilities. This annotation can also be used on a method, in order to get notified when a capability is registered, so that certain features can be enabled conditionally. The #getCapability method has a second parameter, of type Direction , which can be used to request the specific instance for that one face. If passed null , it can be assumed that the request comes either from within the block or from some place where the side has no meaning, such as a different dimension. In this case a general capability instance that does not care about sides will be requested instead. The return type of #getCapability will correspond to a LazyOptional of the type declared in the capability passed to the method. For the Item Handler capability, this is LazyOptional<IItemHandler> . If the capability is not available for a particular provider, it will return an empty LazyOptional instead.","title":"Using an Existing Capability"},{"location":"datastorage/capabilities/#exposing-a-capability","text":"In order to expose a capability, you will first need an instance of the underlying capability type. Note that you should assign a separate instance to each object that keeps the capability, since the capability will most probably be tied to the containing object. There are two ways to obtain such an instance: through the Capability itself or by explicitly instantiating an implementation of it. The first method is designed to use a default implementation via Capability#getDefaultInstance , if those default values are useful for you. In the case of the Item Handler capability, the default implementation will expose a single slot inventory, which is most probably not what you want. The second method can be used to provide custom implementations. In the case of IItemHandler , the default implementation uses the ItemStackHandler class, which has an optional argument in the constructor, to specify a number of slots. However, relying on the existence of these default implementations should be avoided, as the purpose of the capability system is to prevent loading errors in contexts where the capability is not present, so instantiation should be protected behind a check testing if the capability has been registered (see the remarks about @CapabilityInject in the previous section). Once you have your own instance of the capability interface, you will want to notify users of the capability system that you expose this capability and provide a LazyOptional of the interface reference. This is done by overriding the #getCapability method, and comparing the capability instance with the capability you are exposing. If your machine has different slots based on which side is being queried, you can test this with the side parameter. For Entities and ItemStacks, this parameter can be ignored, but it is still possible to have side as a context, such as different armor slots on a player ( Direction#UP exposing the player\u2019s helmet slot), or about the surrounding blocks in the inventory ( Direction#WEST exposing the input slot of a furnace). Do not forget to fall back to super , otherwise existing attached capabilities will stop working. Capabilities must be invalidated at the end of the provider\u2019s lifecycle via LazyOptional#invalidate . For owned TileEntities and Entities, the LazyOptional can be invalidated within #invalidateCaps . For non-owned providers, a runnable supplying the invalidation should be passed into AttachCapabilitiesEvent#addListener . // Somewhere in your TileEntity subclass LazyOptional<IItemHandler> inventoryHandlerLazyOptional; // Supplied instance (e.g. () -> inventoryHandler) // Ensure laziness as initialization should only happen when needed inventoryHandlerLazyOptional = LazyOptional.of(inventoryHandlerSupplier); @Override public <T> LazyOptional<T> getCapability(Capability<T> cap, Direction side) { if (cap == CapabilityItemHandler.ITEM_HANDLER_CAPABILITY) { return inventoryHandlerLazyOptional.cast(); } return super.getCapability(cap, side); } @Override public void invalidateCaps() { super.invalidateCaps(); inventoryHandlerLazyOptional.invalidate(); } Item s are a special case since their capability providers are stored on an ItemStack . Instead, a provider should be attached through Item#initCapabilities . This should hold your capabilities for the lifecycle of the stack. It is strongly suggested that direct checks in code are used to test for capabilities instead of attempting to rely on maps or other data structures, since capability tests can be done by many objects every tick, and they need to be as fast as possible in order to avoid slowing down the game.","title":"Exposing a Capability"},{"location":"datastorage/capabilities/#attaching-capabilities","text":"As mentioned, attaching capabilities to existing providers, World s, and Chunk s can be done using AttachCapabilitiesEvent . The same event is used for all objects that can provide capabilities.

AttachCapabilitiesEvent<TileEntity> : Fires only for tile entities. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<ItemStack> : Fires only for item stacks. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<World> : Fires only for worlds. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<Chunk> : Fires only for chunks. The generic type cannot be more specific than the above types. For example: If you want to attach capabilities to PlayerEntity , you have to subscribe to the AttachCapabilitiesEvent<Entity> , and then determine that the provided object is an PlayerEntity before attaching the capability. In all cases, the event has a method #addCapability which can be used to attach capabilities to the target object. Instead of adding capabilities themselves to the list, you add capability providers, which have the chance to return capabilities only from certain sides. While the provider only needs to implement ICapabilityProvider , if the capability needs to store data persistently, it is possible to implement ICapabilitySerializable<T extends INBT> which, on top of returning the capabilities, will provide NBT save/load functions.

NBT read/write methods: Does not happen automatically. Attach an ICapabilitySerializable in the event and run the read/write methods from the serializeNBT / deserializeNBT .

The following steps assume you have read the rest of the document and you understand the concepts of the capability system.

As such, every ParticleType must be registered . Each ParticleType takes in two parameters: an overrideLimiter which determines whether the particle renders regardless of distance, and a IParticleData$IDeserializer which is used to read the sent IParticleData on the client. As the base ParticleType is abstract, a single method needs to be implemented: #codec . This represents how to encode and decode the associated IParticleData of the type. Note ParticleType#codec is only used within the biome codec for vanilla implementations. In most cases, there is no need to have any particle data sent to the client. For these instances, it is easier to create a new instance of BasicParticleType : an implementation of ParticleType and IParticleData which does not send any custom data to the client besides the type. Most vanilla implementations use BasicParticleType besides redstone dust for coloring and block/item dependent particles. Important A ParticleType is not needed to make a particle spawn if only referenced on the client. However, it is necessary to use any of the prebuilt logic within ParticleManager or spawn a particle from the server. IParticleData An IParticleData represents the data that each particle takes in. It is also used to send data from particles spawned via the server. All particle spawning methods take in a IParticleData such that it knows the type of the particle and the data associated with spawning one. IParticleData is broken down into three methods: Method Description getType Gets the type definition of the particle, or the ParticleType writeToNetwork Writes the particle data to a buffer on the server to send to the client writeToString Writes the particle data to a string These objects are either constructed on the fly as needed, or they are singletons as a result of being a BasicParticleType .

An IParticleFactory must be registered by subscribing to the ParticleFactoryRegisterEvent on the mod event bus . Within the event, the factory can be registered via ParticleManager#register by supplying an instance of the factory to the method. Important ParticleFactoryRegisterEvent should only be called on the client and thus sided off in some isolated client class, referenced by either DistExecutor or @EventBusSubscriber . TexturesParticle, IAnimatedSprite, and IParticleMetaFactory There are three particle render types that cannot use the above method of registration: PARTICLE_SHEET_OPAQUE , PARTICLE_SHEET_TRANSLUCENT , and PARTICLE_SHEET_LIT . This is because all three of these particle render types use a sprite set that is loaded by the ParticleManager directly.

Finally, the actual sound files to be played are specified. Note that the value is an array; if multiple sound files are specified, the game will randomly choose one to play whenever the sound event is triggered. The two examples represent two different ways to specify a sound file. The wiki has precise details, but generally, long sound files such as background music or music discs should use the second form, because the \u201cstream\u201d argument tells Minecraft to not load the entire sound file into memory but to stream it from disk. The second form can also specify the volume, pitch, and weight of a sound file. In all cases, the path to a sound file for namespace namespace and path path is assets/<namespace>/sounds/<path>.ogg . Therefore mymod:open_chest_sound_file points to assets/mymod/sounds/open_chest_sound_file.ogg , and mymod:music/epic_music points to assets/mymod/sounds/music/epic_music.ogg . Creating Sound Events In order to actually be able to play sounds, a SoundEvent corresponding to an entry in sounds.json must be created. This SoundEvent must then be registered . Normally, the location used to create a sound event should be set as it\u2019s registry name. The SoundEvent acts as a reference to the sound and is passed around to play them. If a mod has an API, it should expose its SoundEvent s in the API. Playing Sounds Vanilla has lots of methods for playing sounds, and it is unclear which to use at times.

Example: An event can be used to perform an action when a Vanilla stick is right clicked. The main event bus used for most events is located at MinecraftForge#EVENT_BUS . There is another event bus for mod specific events located at FMLJavaModLoadingContext#getModEventBus that you should only use in specific cases. More information about this bus can be found below. Every event is fired on one of these busses: most events are fired on the main forge event bus, but some are fired on the mod specific event buses. An event handler is some method that has been registered to an event bus. Creating an Event Handler public class MyForgeEventHandler { @SubscribeEvent public void pickupItem(EntityItemPickupEvent event) { System.out.println(\"Item picked up!\"); } } This event handler listens for the EntityItemPickupEvent , which is, as the name states, posted to the event bus whenever an Entity picks up an item. To register this event handler, use MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(...) and pass it an instance of the class the event handler is within. If you want to register this handler to the mod specific event bus, you should use FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus().register(...) instead. Static Event Handlers An event handler may also be static. The handling method is still annotated with @SubscribeEvent . The only difference from an instance handler is that it is also marked static . In order to register a static event handler, an instance of the class won\u2019t do. The Class itself has to be passed in. An example: public class MyStaticForgeEventHandler { @SubscribeEvent public static void arrowNocked(ArrowNockEvent event) { System.out.println(\"Arrow nocked!\"); } } which must be registered like this: MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(MyStaticForgeEventHandler.class) . Automatically Registering Static Event Handlers A class may be annotated with the @Mod$EventBusSubscriber annotation. Such a class is automatically registered to MinecraftForge#EVENT_BUS when the @Mod class itself is constructed. This is essentially equivalent to adding MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(AnnotatedClass.class); at the end of the @Mod class\u2019s constructor. You can pass the bus you want to listen to the @Mod$EventBusSubscriber annotation. It is recommended you also specify the mod id, since the annotation process may not be able to figure it out, and the bus you are registering to, since it serves as a reminder to make sure you are on the correct one. You can also specify the Dist s or physical sides to load this event subscriber on. This can be used to not load client specific event subscribers on the dedicated server. An example for a static event listener listening to RenderWorldLastEvent which will only be called on the client: @Mod.EventBusSubscriber(modid = \"mymod\", bus = Bus.FORGE, value = Dist.CLIENT) public class MyStaticClientOnlyEventHandler { @SubscribeEvent public static void drawLast(RenderWorldLastEvent event) { System.out.println(\"Drawing!\"); } } Note This does not register an instance of the class; it registers the class itself (i.e. the event handling methods must be static). Canceling If an event can be canceled, it will be marked with the @Cancelable annotation, and the method Event#isCancelable() will return true . The cancel state of a cancelable event may be modified by calling Event#setCanceled(boolean canceled) , wherein passing the boolean value true is interpreted as canceling the event, and passing the boolean value false is interpreted as \u201cun-canceling\u201d the event. However, if the event cannot be canceled (as defined by Event#isCancelable() ), an UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown regardless of the passed boolean value, since the cancel state of a non-cancelable event event is considered immutable. Important Not all events can be canceled! Attempting to cancel an event that is not cancelable will result in an unchecked UnsupportedOperationException being thrown, which is expected to result in the game crashing! Always check that an event can be canceled using Event#isCancelable() before attempting to cancel it! Results Some events have an Event$Result . A result can be one of three things: DENY which stops the event, DEFAULT which uses the Vanilla behavior, and ALLOW which forces the action to take place, regardless if it would have originally. The result of an event can be set by calling #setResult with an Event$Result on the event. Not all events have results; an event with a result will be annotated with @HasResult . Important Different events may use results in different ways, refer to the event\u2019s JavaDoc before using the result. Priority Event handler methods (marked with @SubscribeEvent ) have a priority. You can set the priority of an event handler method by setting the priority value of the annotation. The priority can be any value of the EventPriority enum ( HIGHEST , HIGH , NORMAL , LOW , and LOWEST ). Event handlers with priority HIGHEST are executed first and from there in descending order until LOWEST events which are executed last. Sub Events Many events have different variations of themselves. These can be different but all based around one common factor (e.g. PlayerEvent ) or can be an event that has multiple phases (e.g. PotionBrewEvent ). Take note that if you listen to the parent event class, you will receive calls to your method for all subclasses. Mod Event Bus The mod event bus is primarily used for listening to lifecycle events in which mods should initialize. Each event on the mod bus is required to implement IModBusEvent . Many of these events are also ran in parallel so mods can be initialized at the same time. This does mean you can\u2019t directly execute code from other mods in these events. Use the InterModComms system for that. These are the four most commonly used lifecycle events that are called during mod initialization on the mod event bus: FMLCommonSetupEvent FMLClientSetupEvent & FMLDedicatedServerSetupEvent InterModEnqueueEvent InterModProcessEvent Note The FMLClientSetupEvent and FMLDedicatedServerSetupEvent are only called on their respective distribution. These four lifecycle events are all ran in parallel since they all are a subclass of ParallelDispatchEvent . If you want to run run code on the main thread during any ParallelDispatchEvent , you can use the #enqueueWork to do so. Next to the lifecycle events, there are a few miscellaneous events that are fired on the mod event bus where you can register, set up, or initialize various things. Most of these events are not ran in parallel in contrast to the lifecycle events. A few examples: ColorHandlerEvent ModelBakeEvent TextureStitchEvent RegistryEvent A good rule of thumb: events are fired on the mod event bus when they should be handled during initialization of a mod.","title":"Basic Usage"},{"location":"events/intro/#events","text":"Forge uses an event bus that allows mods to intercept events from various Vanilla and mod behaviors.

A simple mod development environment will not suffice to work with Forge\u2019s codebase directly. Instead, you can use the following guide to help you with your setup and get you started with improving Forge! Forking and Cloning the Repository Like most major open source projects you will find, Forge is hosted on GitHub . If you have contributed to another project before, you will know this process already and can skip right ahead to the next section. For those who are beginners when it comes to collaboration via Git, here are two easy steps to get you started. Note This guide assumes that you already have a GitHub account set up. If you do not, visit their registration page to create an account. Furthermore, this guide is not a tutorial for git\u2019s usage. Please consult different sources first if you are struggling to get it working. Forking First of all, you have to \u201cfork\u201d the MinecraftForge repository by clicking the \u201cFork\u201d button in the upper right hand corner. If you are in an organization, select the account you want your fork to be hosted on. Forking the repository is necessary since not every GitHub user can have free access to every repository. Instead, you create a copy of the original repository to later contribute your changes via a so called Pull Request, which you will learn more about later. Cloning After forking the repository, it is time to get local access to actually make some changes. For this, you need to clone the repository onto your local machine. Using your favorite git client, simply clone your fork into a directory of your choice. As general example, here is a command line snippet that should work on all correctly configured systems and clones the repository into a directory called \u201cMinecraftForge\u201d under the current directory (note that you have to replace <User> with your username): git clone https://github.com/<User>/MinecraftForge Checking out the Correct Branch Forking and cloning the repository are the only mandatory steps to develop for Forge. However, to ease the process of creating Pull Requests for you, it is best to work with branches. It is recommended to create and check out a branch for each PR you plan to submit. This way, you can always keep around the latest changes of Forge for new PRs while you still work on older patches. After completing this step, you are ready to go and set up your development environment. Setting Up the Environment Depending on your favorite IDE, there is a different set of recommended steps you have to follow to successfully set up a development environment. Eclipse Due to the way Eclipse workspaces work, ForgeGradle can do most of the work involved to get you started with a Forge workspace. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory of your cloned fork. Type ./gradlew setup and hit enter. Wait until ForgeGradle is done. Type ./gradlew eclipse and hit enter. This allows Eclipse to detect the \u201cForge\u201d and \u201cClean\u201d subdirectories within projects to import them into the workspace. Open your Eclipse workspace and go to File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into workspace . Browse to the <repo>/projects/ directory for the \u201cRoot directory\u201d option in the dialog that opens. Make sure both \u201cForge\u201d and \u201cClean\u201d are checked and adjust the other settings to your liking. Complete the import by clicking the \u201cFinish\u201d button. That is all it takes to get you up and running with Eclipse. There is no extra steps required to get the test mods running. Simply hit \u201cRun\u201d like in any other project and select the appropriate run configuration. IntelliJ IDEA JetBrains\u2019 flagship IDE comes with great integrated support for Gradle : Forge\u2019s build system of choice. Due to some peculiarities of Minecraft mod development, however, there are additional steps required to get everything to work properly. IDEA 2021 onwards Start IntelliJ IDEA 2021. If you already have another project open, close the project with the File -> Close project option. In the projects tab of the \u201cWelcome to IntelliJ IDEA\u201d window, click the \u201cOpen\u201d button on the top right and select the MinecraftForge folder you cloned earlier. Click \u201cTrust Project\u201d if prompted. After IDEA is done importing the project and indexing its files, run the Gradle setup task. You can do this by: Open the Gradle sidebar on the right hand side of your screen, then open the forge project tree, select Tasks, then other and double-click the setup task (may also appear as MinecraftForge[Setup] ) found in Forge -> Tasks -> other -> setup . If you get a licensing error during build before making any changes, running the updateLicenses task may help. This task is found in Forge -> Tasks -> other as well. IDEA 2019-2020 There are a few minor differences between IDEA 2021 and these versions for setup. Import Forge\u2019s build.gradle as an IDEA project. For this, simply click Import Project from the Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA splash screen, then select the build.gradle file. After IDEA is done importing the project and indexing the files, run the Gradle setup task. Either: Open the Gradle sidebar on the right hand side of your screen, then open the forge project tree, select Tasks , then other and double-click the setup task (may also appear as MinecraftForge[Setup] . Or alternatively: Tap the CTRL key twice, and type gradle setup in the Run command window that pops up. You can then run Forge using the forge_client gradle task ( Tasks -> fg_runs -> forge_client ): right-click the task and select either Run or Debug as desired. IDEA older versions Versions older than 2016 will not work because they did not have the appropriate Gradle support nor support Forge development multi-project workspaces. IDEA 2016 - 2018 will work with extra manual steps required, but it is strongly recommended to update to IDEA 2019+ instead. cpw has uploaded a video for IDEA 2016.1 explaining very similar steps which will lead to a working setup. That is all there is to creating a Forge development environment in IntelliJ IDEA. However, you will not be able to run tests and debug mods included in Forge straight away. This takes some extra effort. Enabling test mods To enable the test mods coming with Forge, you will need to add the compiler output to the classpath. Again, cpw has put up a video explaining these steps for IDEA 2016.1. Build the test classes by selecting the src/main/test directory in your project view and then run Build -> Build module 'Forge_test' from the menu bar. Open the \u201cProject Structure\u201d window under File -> Project Structure . Head to the \u201cModules\u201d section and expand the Forge module. Select the Forge_test submodule and head to the \u201cPaths\u201d tab. Remember the path listed under the \u201cTest output path\u201d label and select the Forge_main submodule from the tree. Open the \u201cDependencies\u201d tab, hit the green plus button on the right-hand side, and select \u201cJARs or directories\u201d. Navigate to the path previously displayed as the Forge_test output path and confirm your selection. For the \u201cScope\u201d of this newly added dependency (currently \u201cCompile\u201d) choose \u201cRuntime\u201d, since the main code does not rely on the test code for compilation. Now that you have added the test mods to the classpath, you need to rebuild them each time you make a change, as they will not be built automatically. To do so, repeat step 1 from the above list or, in case you make changes to a single test mod file and want them to get rebuilt, simply hit Build -> Rebuild project or the corresponding keyboard shortcut (CTRL+F9 by default). Testing with existing mods You might want to test changes in Forge with an existing project. The video by cpw linked in the test mods section also covers this for IDEA 2016.1. Getting the mod to run requires similar steps to the test mod, but getting your project added to the workspace requires some additional work. Open the \u201cProject Structure\u201d Window under File -> Project Structure . Head to the \u201cModules\u201d section and press the green plus icon above the tree view. Select \u201cImport Module\u201d, navigate to your project\u2019s build.gradle file, and confirm your selection as well as the import settings. Close the \u201cProject Structure\u201d window by clicking the \u201cOK\u201d button. Reopen the window after IDEA is done importing the project and select your project\u2019s _main module from the tree. Open the \u201cDependencies\u201d tab, click the green plus icon on the right-hand side, and select \u201cModule dependency\u201d. In the window that just opened, select the Forge_main module. From here on, reproduce the steps from the test mods section, just with your project\u2019s _main module instead of the Forge_test one. Note You might need to remove existing dependencies from a normal development environment (mainly references to a forgeSrc JAR) or move the Forge module higher up in the dependency list. You should now be able to work with your mod using the changes you introduce to the Forge and Vanilla codebase. Making Changes and Pull Requests Once you have set up your development environment, it is time to make some changes to Forge\u2019s codebase. There are, however, some pitfalls you have to avoid when editing the project\u2019s code. The most important thing to note is that if you wish to edit Minecraft source code, you must only do so in the \u201cForge\u201d sub-project. Any changes in the \u201cClean\u201d project will mess with ForgeGradle and generating the patches. This can have disastrous consequences and might render your environment completely useless. If you wish to have a flawless experience, make sure you only edit code in the \u201cForge\u201d project! Generating Patches After you have made changes to the code base and tested them thoroughly, you may go ahead and generate patches. This is only necessary if you work on the Minecraft code base (i.e. in the \u201cForge\u201d project), but this step is vital for your changes to work elsewhere. Forge works by injecting only changed things into Vanilla Minecraft and hence needs those changes available in an appropriate format. Thankfully, ForgeGradle is capable of generating the changeset for you to commit it. To initiate the patch generation, simply run the genPatches Gradle task from your IDE or the command line. After its completion, you can commit all your changes (make sure you do not add any unnecessary files) and submit your Pull Request! Pull Requests The last step before your contribution is added to Forge is a Pull Request (PR in short). This is a formal request to incorporate your fork\u2019s changes into the live code base. Creating a PR is easy. Simply go to this GitHub page and follow the proposed steps. It is now that a good setup with branches pays off, since you are able to select precisely the changes you want to submit. Note Pull Requests are bound to rules; not every request will blindly be accepted. Follow this document to get further information and to ensure the best quality of your PR!

When modders run into something like that, they can make a change to Forge to support it, and submit that change as a Pull Request on Github. To make the best use of both your and the Forge team\u2019s time, it is recommended to follow some rough guidelines when preparing a Pull Request. The following points are the most important aspects to keep in mind when it comes to writing a good Pull Request. What Exactly is Forge? At a high level, Forge is a mod compatibility layer on top of Minecraft. Early mods edited Minecraft\u2019s code directly (like coremods do now), but they ran into conflicts with each other when they edited the same things. They also ran into issues when one mod changed behavior in ways that the other mods could not anticipate (like coremods do now), causing mysterious issues and lots of headaches. By using something like Forge, mods can centralize common changes and avoid conflicts. Forge also includes supporting structures for common mod features like Capabilities, Registries, and others that allow mods to work together better. When writing a good Forge Pull Request, you also have to know what Forge is at a lower level. There are two main types of code in Forge: Minecraft patches, and Forge code. Patches Patches are applied as direct changes to Minecraft\u2019s source code, and aim to be as minimal as possible. Every time Minecraft code changes, all the Forge patches need to be looked over carefully and applied correctly to the new code. This means that large patches that change lots of things are difficult to maintain, so Forge aims to avoid those and keep patches as small as possible. In addition to making sure the code makes sense, reviews for patches will focus on minimizing the size. There are many strategies to make small patches, and reviews will often point out better methods to do things. Forge patches often insert a single line that fires an event or a code hook, which affects the code after it if the event meets some condition. This allows most of the code to exist outside of the patch, which keeps the patch small and simple. For more detailed information about creating patches, see the GitHub wiki . Forge Code Aside from the patches, Forge code is just normal Java code. It can be event code, compatibility features, or anything else that is not directly editing Minecraft code. When Minecraft updates, Forge code has to update just like everything else. However, it is much easier because it is not directly entangled in the Minecraft code. Because this code stands on its own, there is no size restriction like there is with the patches. In addition to making sure the code makes sense, reviews will focus on making the code clean: with proper formatting and Java documentation. Explain Yourself All Pull Requests need to answer the question: why is this necessary? Any code added to Forge needs to be maintained, and more code means more potential for bugs, so solid justification is needed for adding code. A common Pull Request issue is offering no explanation, or giving cryptic examples for how the Pull Request might theoretically be used. This only delays the Pull Request process. A clear explanation for the general case is good, but also give a concrete example of how your mod needs this Pull Request. Sometimes there is better way to do what you wanted, or a way to do it without a Pull Request at all. Code changes can not be accepted until those possibilities have been completely ruled out. Show that it Works The code you submit to Forge should work perfectly, and it is up to you to convince the reviewers that it does. One of the best ways to do that is to add an example mod or JUnit test to Forge that makes use of your new code and shows it working. To set up and run a Forge Environment with the example mods, see this guide . Breaking Changes in Forge Forge cannot make changes that break the mods that depend on it. This means that Pull Requests have to ensure that they do not break binary compatibility with previous Forge versions. A change that breaks binary compatibility is called a Breaking Change. There are some exceptions to this: Forge accepts Breaking Changes at the beginning of new Minecraft versions, where Minecraft itself already causes Breaking Changes for modders. Sometimes an emergency breaking change is required outside of that time window, but it is rare and can cause dependency headaches for everyone in the modded Minecraft community. Outside of those exceptional times, Pull Requests with breaking changes are not accepted. They must be adapted to support the old behavior or wait for the next Minecraft version. Be Patient, Civil, and Empathetic When submitting Pull Requests, you will often have to survive code review and make several changes before it is the best Pull Request possible. Keep in mind that code review is not judgement against you. Bugs in your code are not personal. Nobody is perfect, and that is why we are working together. Negativity will not help. Threatening to give up on your Pull Request and write a coremod instead will just make people upset and make the modded ecosystem worse. It is important that while working together you assume the best intentions of the people who are reviewing your Pull Request and not take things personally. Review If you do your best to understand the slow and perfectionistic nature of the Pull Request process, we will do our best to understand your point of view as well.

The rest of this documentation is about where to go from here. From Zero to Modding Obtain a Java 8 Development Kit (JDK) and a 64-bit Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Minecraft and MinecraftForge both compile against Java 8 and as such should be used for development. Using a 32-bit JVM will result in some problems when running the below gradle tasks. You can obtain one from AdoptOpenJDK . Obtain the Mod Development Kit (MDK) from Forge\u2019s files site. Extract the downloaded MDK into an empty directory. You should see a bunch of files along with an example mod placed in src/main/java for you to look at. Only a few of these files are strictly necessary for mod development, and you may reuse these files for all your projects. These files are: build.gradle gradlew.bat gradlew the gradle folder Move the files listed above to a new folder. This will be your mod project folder. Choose your IDE: Forge only explicitly supports developing with Eclipse, but there are additional run tasks for IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code environments. However, any environment, from Netbeans to vim/emacs, can be made to work. For both Intellij IDEA and Eclipse, their Gradle integration will handle the rest of the initial workspace setup. This includes downloading packages from Mojang, MinecraftForge, and a few other software sharing sites. For VSCode, the \u2018Gradle Tasks\u2019 plugin can be used to handle the initial workspace setup. For most, if not all, changes to the build.gradle file to take effect, Gradle will need to be invoked to re-evaluate the project. This can be done through \u2018Refresh\u2019 buttons in the Gradle panels of both of the previously mentioned IDEs. Generating IDE Launch/Run Configurations: For Eclipse, run the genEclipseRuns gradle task ( gradlew genEclipseRuns ). This will generate the Launch Configurations and download any required assets for the game to run. After this has finished, refresh your project. For IntelliJ, run the genIntellijRuns gradle task ( gradlew genIntellijRuns ). This will generate the Run Configurations and download any required assets for the game to run. If you encounter an error saying \u201cmodule not specified\u201d, you can either edit the configuration to select your \u201cmain\u201d module or specify it through the ideaModule property. For VSCode, run the genVSCodeRuns gradle task ( gradlew genVSCodeRuns ). This will generate the Launch Configurations and download any required assets for the game to run. Customizing Your Mod Information Edit the build.gradle file to customize how your mod is built (the file names, versions, and other things). Important Do not edit the buildscript {} section of the build.gradle file, its default text is necessary for ForgeGradle to function. Almost anything underneath the // Only edit below this line, the above code adds and enables the necessary things for Forge to be setup. marker can be changed. Many things can be removed and customized there as well. Simple build.gradle Customizations These customizations are highly recommended for all projects. To change the name of the file you build - edit the value of archivesBaseName to suit. To change your \u201cmaven coordinates\u201d - edit the value of group as well. To change the version number - edit the value of version . To update the run configurations - replace all occurrences of examplemod to the mod id of your mod. Migration to Mojang\u2019s Official Mappings As of 1.16.5, Forge will be using Mojang\u2019s Official Mappings, or MojMaps, for the forseeable future. The official mappings provide all method and field names, with the class names coming in 1.17. Parameters and javadocs are not provided by this mapping set. Currently, there is no guarantee that these mappings are legally safe; however, Forge has decided to adopt them in good faith since Mojang wants them to be used. You can read about Forge\u2019s stance here . If you are uncomfortable using these mappings, you can revert them back the previously used mappings: MCP. MCP provides a partial list of mapped methods, fields, parameters and javadocs. Note that the following will most likely be the last MCP mappings released as they are no longer being maintained: minecraft { mappings channel: 'snapshot', version: '20210309-1.16.5' } Building and Testing Your Mod To build your mod, run gradlew build . This will output a file in build/libs with the name [archivesBaseName]-[version].jar . This file can be placed in the mods folder of a Forge enabled Minecraft setup or distributed. To test run your mod, the easiest way is to use the run configs that were generated when you set up your project. Otherwise, you can run gradlew runClient . This will launch Minecraft from the <runDir> location along with your mod\u2019s code in any source sets specified within your run configurations. The default MDK includes the main source set, so any code written within src/main/java will be applied. You can also run a dedicated server using the server run config or via gradlew runServer .

Minecraft and MinecraftForge both compile against Java 8 and as such should be used for development. Using a 32-bit JVM will result in some problems when running the below gradle tasks. You can obtain one from AdoptOpenJDK . Obtain the Mod Development Kit (MDK) from Forge\u2019s files site. Extract the downloaded MDK into an empty directory. You should see a bunch of files along with an example mod placed in src/main/java for you to look at. Only a few of these files are strictly necessary for mod development, and you may reuse these files for all your projects. These files are: build.gradle gradlew.bat gradlew the gradle folder Move the files listed above to a new folder. This will be your mod project folder. Choose your IDE: Forge only explicitly supports developing with Eclipse, but there are additional run tasks for IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code environments. However, any environment, from Netbeans to vim/emacs, can be made to work. For both Intellij IDEA and Eclipse, their Gradle integration will handle the rest of the initial workspace setup. This includes downloading packages from Mojang, MinecraftForge, and a few other software sharing sites. For VSCode, the \u2018Gradle Tasks\u2019 plugin can be used to handle the initial workspace setup. For most, if not all, changes to the build.gradle file to take effect, Gradle will need to be invoked to re-evaluate the project. This can be done through \u2018Refresh\u2019 buttons in the Gradle panels of both of the previously mentioned IDEs. Generating IDE Launch/Run Configurations: For Eclipse, run the genEclipseRuns gradle task ( gradlew genEclipseRuns ). This will generate the Launch Configurations and download any required assets for the game to run. After this has finished, refresh your project. For IntelliJ, run the genIntellijRuns gradle task ( gradlew genIntellijRuns ). This will generate the Run Configurations and download any required assets for the game to run. If you encounter an error saying \u201cmodule not specified\u201d, you can either edit the configuration to select your \u201cmain\u201d module or specify it through the ideaModule property. For VSCode, run the genVSCodeRuns gradle task ( gradlew genVSCodeRuns ).

If any mods have an available update, it will show a flashing icon on the \u2018Mods\u2019 button of the main menu and mod list along with the respective changelogs. It does not download updates automatically. Getting Started The first thing you want to do is specify the updateJSONURL parameter in your mods.toml file. The value of this parameter should be a valid URL pointing to an update JSON file. This file can be hosted on your own web server, GitHub, or wherever you want as long as it can be reliably reached by all users of your mod. Update JSON format The JSON itself has a relatively simple format as follows: { \"homepage\": \"<homepage/download page for your mod>\", \"<mcversion>\": { \"<modversion>\": \"<changelog for this version>\", // List all versions of your mod for the given Minecraft version, along with their changelogs ... }, \"promos\": { \"<mcversion>-latest\": \"<modversion>\", // Declare the latest \"bleeding-edge\" version of your mod for the given Minecraft version \"<mcversion>-recommended\": \"<modversion>\", // Declare the latest \"stable\" version of your mod for the given Minecraft version ... } } This is fairly self-explanatory, but some notes: The link under homepage is the link the user will be shown when the mod is outdated. Forge uses an internal algorithm to determine whether one version string of your mod is \u201cnewer\u201d than another. Most versioning schemes should be compatible, but see the ComparableVersion class if you are concerned about whether your scheme is supported. Adherence to semantic versioning is highly recommended. The changelog string can be separated into lines using \\n . Some prefer to include a abbreviated changelog, then link to an external site that provides a full listing of changes.

You can use your email, a subdomain of where you host a website, or your name/username as long as it can be unique. After the top level package (if you have one), you append a unique name for your mod, such as examplemod . In our case it will end up as com.example.examplemod .

The Mod File Generally, we will start with a file named after your mod and put into your package. This is the entry point to your mod and will contain some special indicators marking it as such. What is @Mod ? This is an annotation indicating to the Forge Mod Loader that the class is a Mod entry point. The @Mod annotation\u2019s value should match a mod id in the src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml file. Keeping Your Code Clean Using Sub-packages Rather than clutter up a single class and package with everything, it is recommended that you break your mod into subpackages. A common subpackage strategy has packages for common and client code, which is code that can be run on both server/client and only client, respectively. Inside the common package would go things like Items, Blocks, and Tile Entities (which can each, in turn, be another subpackage). Things like Screens and Renderers would go inside the client package. Note This package style is only a suggestion, though it is a commonly used style. Feel free to use your own packaging system. By keeping your code in clean subpackages, you can grow your mod much more organically. Class Naming Schemes A common class naming scheme allows easier deciphering of what a class is, and it also makes it easier for someone developing with your mod to find things. For Example: An Item called PowerRing would be in an item package, with a class name of PowerRingItem . A Block called NotDirt would be in a block package, with a class name of NotDirtBlock . Finally, a TileEntity for a block called SuperChewer would be a tile or tileentity package, with a class name of SuperChewerTile .

These are instances generated each time a serializer decodes the information from JSON and supplies it into this object. There is only one method that needs to be defined in order to create a new modifier: #apply . This takes in the current loot that will be generated along with the context information such as the currently level or additional defined parameters. It returns the list of drops to generate. Note The returned list of drops from any one modifier is fed into other modifiers in the order they are registered. As such, modified loot can be modified by another loot modifier. The LootModifier Subclass LootModifier is an abstract implementation of IGlobalLootModifier to provide the base functionality which most modders can easily extend and implement. This expands upon the existing interface by defining the #apply method to check the conditions to determine whether or not to modify the generated loot. There are two things of note within the subclass implementation: the constructor which must take in an array of ILootCondition s and the #doApply method. The array of ILootCondition s define the list of conditions that must be true before the loot can be modified. The supplied conditions are ANDed together, meaning that all conditions must be true. The #doApply method works the same as the #apply method except that it only executes once all conditions return true. public class ExampleModifier extends LootModifier { public ExampleModifier(ILootCondition[] conditionsIn, String prop1, int prop2, Item prop3) { super(conditionsIn); // Store the rest of the parameters } @Nonnull @Override protected List<ItemStack> doApply(List<ItemStack> generatedLoot, LootContext context) { // Modify the loot and return the new drops } } GlobalLootModifierSerializer The connector between the JSON and the IGlobalLootModifier instance is the GlobalLootModifierSerializer<T> implementation, where T represents the type of the IGlobalLootModifier to use. Two methods must be defined within the serializer implementation: #read and #write . #read takes in the registry name of the JSON, the serialized JsonObject , and the array of conditions that, by most implementations, must be true to allow the loot modifier to execute. The only data that should be deserialized from the JsonObject are the custom properties specified for use by the implemented loot modifier. If no custom properties are needed, then no data should be deserialized from the JsonObject as the conditions are supplied as a parameter. #write is responsible for turning the defined loot modifier and writing it to a JsonObject . This requires that all conditions along with any custom properties must be written. For ease of convenience, #makeConditions can be called to create a new JsonObject with the conditions already serialized within. Any additional properties to be serialized can then be added to this JsonObject .

It can be a simple cube, it can be several cubes, it can be a truncated icosidodecahedron, or anything in between. Most models you\u2019ll see will be in the vanilla JSON format. Models in other formats are loaded into IModelGeometry s by an IModelLoader at runtime. Forge provides default implementations for WaveFront OBJ files, buckets, composite models, models in different render layers, and a reimplementation of Vanilla\u2019s builtin/generated item model. Most things do not care about what loaded the model or what format it\u2019s in as they are all eventually represented by an IBakedModel in code. When ResourceLocation refers to a model, the path is normally relative to models (e.g. examplemod:block/block \u2192 assets/examplemod/models/block/block.json ). Block and item models differ in a few ways, the major one being item property overrides . Textures Textures, like models, are contained within resource packs and are referred to with ResourceLocation s. When ResourceLocation s refer to textures in models, the paths are taken to be relative to textures/ (e.g. examplemod:block/test \u2192 assets/examplemod/textures/block/test.png ). Additionally, in Minecraft, the UV coordinates (0,0) are taken to mean the top-left corner. UVs are always from 0 to 16. If a texture is larger or smaller, the coordinates are scaled to fit. A texture should also be square, and the side length of a texture should be a power of two, as doing otherwise breaks mipmapping (e.g. 1x1, 2x2, 8x8, 16x16, and 128x128 are good. 5x5 and 30x30 are not recommended because they are not powers of 2. 5x10 and 4x8 are completely broken as they are not square.). If there is an mcmeta file associated with the texture, and an animation is defined, the image can be rectangular and is interpreted as a vertical sequence of square regions from top to bottom, where each square is a frame of the animation. JSON Models Vanilla Minecraft\u2019s JSON model format is rather simple. It defines cuboid (cube/rectangular prism) elements and assigns textures to their faces. On the wiki , there is a definition of its format. Note JSON models only support cuboid elements; there is no way to express a triangular wedge or anything like it. To have more complicated models, another format must be used. When a ResourceLocation refers to the location of a JSON model, it is not suffixed with .json , unlike OBJ models (e.g. minecraft:block/cube_all , not minecraft:block/cube_all.json ). WaveFront OBJ Models Forge adds a loader for the .obj file format. To use these models, the JSON must reference the forge:obj loader. This loader accepts any model location that is in a registered namespace and whose path ends in .obj . The .mtl file should be placed in the same location with the same name as the .obj to be used automatically. The .mtl file will probably have to be manually edited to change the paths pointing to textures defined within the JSON. Additionally, the V axis for textures may be flipped depending on the external program that created the model (i.e. V = 0 may be the bottom edge, not the top). This may be rectified in the modelling program itself or done in the model JSON like so: { \"__comment\": \"Add the following line on the same level as a 'model' declaration.\", \"loader\": \"forge:obj\", \"flip-v\": true, \"model\": \"examplemod:models/block/model.obj\", \"textures\": { \"_comment\": \"Can refer to in .mtl using #texture0\", \"texture0\": \"minecraft:block/dirt\", \"particle\": \"minecraft:block/dirt\" } }","title":"Model Files"},{"location":"models/files/#model-files","text":"A \u201cmodel\u201d is simply a shape.

BlockModelShapes uses the block\u2019s registry name as the location of the blockstate JSON. (E.g. block examplemod:testblock goes to the ResourceLocation examplemod:testblock .) The variant string is pieced together from the blockstate\u2019s properties. As an example, let\u2019s take a look at the vanilla oak_log.json : { \"variants\": { \"axis=y\": { \"model\": \"block/oak_log\" }, \"axis=z\": { \"model\": \"block/oak_log\", \"x\": 90 }, \"axis=x\": { \"model\": \"block/oak_log\", \"x\": 90, \"y\": 90 } } } Here we define 3 variant strings, and for each we use a certain model, either the upright log and the sideways log (rotated in the y direction or not). These variants will define the look of a log depending on the property axis . A variant should be defined for every property that invokes a change in the model displayed. Any property not specified in the JSON will not have any bearing to determine the current model (e.g. waterlogged has no effect on how a model might look). Each blockstate can be specified using one of two methods: variants and multiparts. A variant defines an associated array of states which point to the associated model to render. Note that every single property that changes the model must be defined (e.g. If 4 properties defines how the model looks, then 2 ^ 4 = 16 variants must be defined). Multiparts, on the other hand, use conditions to display a certain model when true (e.g. If a model is only shown when north was true, then when that case occurs, the model will display along with any other models whose conditions are met). For a better understanding of multiparts, let\u2019s look at a variant built fence connection: \"east=true,north=false,south=false,west=false\": { \"model\": \"oak_fence_n\", \"y\": 90, \"uvlock\": true } This represents one variant out of 16 possible states. Even worse, there must be models that can uniquely define unique states (a state that can be rotated to become another state is not unique for this purpose). For fences, there are 6 models: one for no connections, one connection, two connections in a straight line, two perpendicular connections, three connections, and one for all four connections. Now let\u2019s view a modern day multipart built fence connection: { \"when\": { \"east\": \"true\" }, \"apply\": { \"model\": \"oak_fence_side\", \"y\": 90, \"uvlock\": true } } In this case, the JSON defines that if the east connector is true, then show the model oak_fence_side rotated 90 degrees. This allows the model to be broken up in only two files: the base post and the connection. It can also be represented as 5 statements, one that checks for each of the states is true and one that applies the base post unconditionally.

Using this system is by far the easiest way to send custom data between clients and the server. Getting Started First you need to create your SimpleChannel object. We recommend that you do this in a separate class, possibly something like ModidPacketHandler . Create your SimpleChannel as a static field in this class, like so: private static final String PROTOCOL_VERSION = \"1\"; public static final SimpleChannel INSTANCE = NetworkRegistry.newSimpleChannel( new ResourceLocation(\"mymodid\", \"main\"), () -> PROTOCOL_VERSION, PROTOCOL_VERSION::equals, PROTOCOL_VERSION::equals ); The first argument is a name for the channel. The second argument is a Supplier<String> returning the current network protocol version. The third and fourth arguments respectively are Predicate<String> checking whether an incoming connection protocol version is network-compatible with the client or server, respectively. Here, we simply compare with the PROTOCOL_VERSION field directly, meaning that the client and server PROTOCOL_VERSION s must always match or FML will deny login. The Version Checker If your mod does not require the other side to have a specific network channel, or to be a Forge instance at all, you should take care that you properly define your version compatibility checkers (the Predicate<String> parameters) to handle additional \u201cmeta-versions\u201d (defined in NetworkRegistry ) that can be received by the version checker. These are: ABSENT - if this channel is missing on the other endpoint. Note that in this case, the endpoint is still a Forge endpoint, and may have other mods. ACCEPTVANILLA - if the endpoint is a vanilla (or non-Forge) endpoint. Returning false for both means that this channel must be present on the other endpoint. If you just copy the code above, this is what it does. Note that these values are also used during the list ping compatibility check, which is responsible for showing the green check / red cross in the multiplayer server select screen. Registering Packets Next, we must declare the types of messages that we would like to send and receive. This is done using INSTANCE#registerMessage , which takes 5 parameters: The first parameter is the discriminator for the packet. This is a per-channel unique ID for the packet. We recommend you use a local variable to hold the ID, and then call registerMessage using id++ . This will guarantee 100% unique IDs. The second parameter is the actual packet class MSG . The third parameter is a BiConsumer<MSG, PacketBuffer> responsible for encoding the message into the provided PacketBuffer . The fourth parameter is a Function<PacketBuffer, MSG> responsible for decoding the message from the provided PacketBuffer . The final parameter is a BiConsumer<MSG, Supplier<NetworkEvent.Context>> responsible for handling the message itself. The last three parameters can be method references to either static or instance methods in Java. Remember that an instance method MSG#encode(PacketBuffer) still satisfies BiConsumer<MSG, PacketBuffer> ; the MSG simply becomes the implicit first argument. Handling Packets There are a couple things to highlight in a packet handler. A packet handler has both the message object and the network context available to it. The context allows access to the player that sent the packet (if on the server), and a way to enqueue thread-safe work. public static void handle(MyMessage msg, Supplier<NetworkEvent.Context> ctx) { ctx.get().enqueueWork(() -> { // Work that needs to be thread-safe (most work) ServerPlayerEntity sender = ctx.get().getSender(); // the client that sent this packet // Do stuff }); ctx.get().setPacketHandled(true); } Packets sent from the server to the client should be handled in another class and wrapped via DistExecutor#unsafeRunWhenOn . // In Packet class public static void handle(MyClientMessage msg, Supplier<NetworkEvent.Context> ctx) { ctx.get().enqueueWork(() -> // Make sure it's only executed on the physical client DistExecutor.unsafeRunWhenOn(Dist.CLIENT, () -> () -> ClientPacketHandlerClass.handlePacket(msg, ctx)) ); ctx.get().setPacketHandled(true); } // In ClientPacketHandlerClass public static void handlePacket(MyClientMessage msg, Supplier<NetworkEvent.Context> ctx) { // Do stuff } Note the presence of #setPacketHandled , which is used to tell the network system that the packet has successfully completed handling. Warning As of Minecraft 1.8 packets are by default handled on the network thread. That means that your handler can not interact with most game objects directly. Forge provides a convenient way to make your code execute on the main thread instead through the supplied NetworkEvent$Context . Simply call NetworkEvent$Context#enqueueWork(Runnable) , which will call the given Runnable on the main thread at the next opportunity. Warning Be defensive when handling packets on the server. A client could attempt to exploit the packet handling by sending unexpected data. A common problem is vulnerability to arbitrary chunk generation . This typically happens when the server is trusting a block position sent by a client to access blocks and tile entities. When accessing blocks and tile entities in unloaded areas of the world, the server will either generate or load this area from disk, then promptly write it to disk. This can be exploited to cause catastrophic damage to a server\u2019s performance and storage space without leaving a trace. To avoid this problem, a general rule of thumb is to only access blocks and tile entities if World#hasChunkAt is true. Sending Packets Sending to the Server There is but one way to send a packet to the server. This is because there is only ever one server the client can be connected to at once. To do so, we must again use that SimpleChannel that was defined earlier. Simply call INSTANCE.sendToServer(new MyMessage()) . The message will be sent to the handler for its type, if one exists. Sending to Clients Packets can be sent directly to a client using the SimpleChannel : HANDLER.sendTo(new MyClientMessage(), serverPlayer.connection.getConnection(), NetworkDirection.PLAY_TO_CLIENT) . However, this can be quite inconvenient. Forge has some convenience functions that can be used: // Send to one player INSTANCE.send(PacketDistributor.PLAYER.with(serverPlayer), new MyMessage()); // Send to all players tracking this chunk INSTANCE.send(PacketDistributor.TRACKING_CHUNK.with(chunk), new MyMessage()); // Send to all connected players INSTANCE.send(PacketDistributor.ALL.noArg(), new MyMessage()); There are additional PacketDistributor types available; check the documentation on the PacketDistributor class for more details.","title":"SimpleImpl"},{"location":"networking/simpleimpl/#simpleimpl","text":"SimpleImpl is the name given to the packet system that revolves around the SimpleChannel class.

They are used to store dynamic data, execute tick based tasks, and dynamic rendering. Some examples from vanilla Minecraft would be handling of inventories on chests, smelting logic on furnaces, or area effects on beacons. More advanced examples exist in mods, such as quarries, sorting machines, pipes, and displays. Note TileEntities aren\u2019t a solution for everything and they can cause lag when used wrongly. When possible, try to avoid them. Registering Tile Entities are created and removed dynamically and as such are not registry objects on their own. In order to create a TileEntity , you need to extend the TileEntity class. As such, another object is registered instead to easily create and refer to the type of the dynamic object. For a TileEntity , these are known as TileEntityType s. A TileEntityType can be registered like any other registry object. To construct a TileEntityType , its builder form can be used via TileEntityType$Builder#of . This takes in two arguments: a factory representing some supplied method to create a new instance of the associated TileEntity , and a varargs of validBlocks which this TileEntity can be attached to. Building the TileEntityType is done by calling TileEntityType$Builder#build . This takes in a Type which represents the type-safe reference used to refer to this registry object in a DataFixer . Since DataFixer s are an optional system to use for mods, this can be passed as null . // For some DeferredRegister<TileEntityType<?>> REGISTER public static final RegistryObject<TileEntityType<MyTE>> MY_TE = REGISTER.register(\"myte\", () -> TileEntityType.Builder.of(factory, validBlocks).build(null)); Creating a TileEntity To create a TileEntity and attach it to a Block , two methods must be overridden within the Block subclass: IForgeBlock#hasTileEntity(BlockState state) IForgeBlock#createTileEntity(BlockState state, IBlockReader world) In most cases, #hasTileEntity will return true to indicate the block has a TileEntity and return a new instance of said TileEntity within #createTileEntity . Storing Data within your TileEntity In order to save data, override the following two methods: TileEntity#save(CompoundNBT nbt) TileEntity#load(BlockState state, CompoundNBT nbt) These methods are called whenever the Chunk containing the TileEntity gets loaded from/saved to NBT. Use them to read and write to the fields in your tile entity class. Note Whenever your data changes, you need to call TileEntity#setChanged ; otherwise, the Chunk containing your TileEntity might be skipped while the world is saved. Important It is important that you call the super methods! The tag names id , x , y , z , ForgeData and ForgeCaps are reserved by the super methods. Ticking TileEntities If you need a ticking TileEntity , for example to keep track of the progress during a smelting process, you need to add the net.minecraft.tileentity.ITickableTileEntity interface to your TileEntity . Now you can implement all your calculations within ITickableTileEntity#tick . Note This method is called each tick; therefore, you should avoid having complicated calculations in here. If possible, you should make more complex calculations every X ticks. (The amount of ticks in a second may be lower then 20 (twenty) but won\u2019t be higher) Synchronizing the Data to the Client There are three ways of syncing data to the client: synchronizing on chunk load, on block updates, and with a custom network message. Synchronizing on Chunk Load For this you need to override TileEntity#getUpdateTag() IForgeTileEntity#handleUpdateTag(BlockState state, CompoundNBT nbt) Again, this is pretty simple, the first method collects the data that should be sent to the client, while the second one processes that data. If your TileEntity doesn\u2019t contain much data, you might be able to use the methods out of the Storing Data within your TileEntity section. Important Synchronizing excessive/useless data for tile entities can lead to network congestion. You should optimize your network usage by sending only the information the client needs when the client needs it. For instance, it is more often than not unnecessary to send the inventory of a tile entity in the update tag, as this can be synchronized via its GUI. Synchronizing on Block Update This method is a bit more complicated, but again you just need to override two methods. Here is a tiny example implementation of it: @Override public SUpdateTileEntityPacket getUpdatePacket(){ CompoundNBT nbtTag = new CompoundNBT(); //Write your data into the nbtTag return new SUpdateTileEntityPacket(getBlockPos(), -1, nbtTag); } @Override public void onDataPacket(NetworkManager net, SUpdateTileEntityPacket pkt){ CompoundNBT tag = pkt.getTag(); //Handle your Data } The Constructor of SUpdateTileEntityPacket takes: The position of your TileEntity . An ID, though it isn\u2019t really used besides by Vanilla; therefore, you can just put a -1 in there. An CompoundNBT which should contain your data. Now, to send the packet, an update notification must be given on the server. World#sendBlockUpdated(BlockPos pos, BlockState oldState, BlockState newState, int flags) The pos should be your TileEntity \u2018s position. For oldState and newState , you can pass the current BlockState at that position. flags is a bitmask that should contain 2 , which will sync the changes to the client. See Constants$BlockFlags for more info as well as the rest of the flags. The flag 2 is equivalent to Constants$BlockFlags#BLOCK_UPDATE . Synchronizing Using a Custom Network Message This way of synchronizing is probably the most complicated but is usually the most optimized, as you can make sure that only the data you need to be synchronized is actually synchronized. You should first check out the Networking section and especially SimpleImpl before attempting this. Once you\u2019ve created your custom network message, you can send it to all users that have the TileEntity loaded with SimpleChannel#send(PacketDistributor$PacketTarget, MSG) . Warning It is important that you do safety checks, the TileEntity might already be destroyed/replaced when the message arrives at the player! You should also check if the chunk is loaded ( World#hasChunkAt(BlockPos) ).","title":"Home"},{"location":"tileentities/tileentity/#tileentities","text":"TileEntities are like simplified Entities that are bound to a Block.

Since then, it has been adopted by Forge and expanded in Minecraft 1.13 into datapacks . Loading Recipes Forge will load all recipes which can be found within the ./data/<modid>/recipes/ folder. You can call these files whatever you want, though the vanilla convention is to name them after the output item. For multiple recipes from different sources (Smelting, Crafting, etc), one vanilla convention is to use item_name_from_smelting.json . This name is also used as the registration key, but it does not affect the operation of the recipe. The Recipe file A basic recipe file might look like the following example: { \"type\": \"minecraft:crafting_shaped\", \"pattern\": [ \"xxa\", \"x x\", \"xxx\" ], \"key\": { \"x\": { \"tag\": \"forge:gems/diamond\" }, \"a\": { \"item\": \"mymod:myfirstitem\" } }, \"result\": { \"item\": \"mymod:myitem\", \"count\": 9 } } Note When you first obtain an ingredient to a vanilla recipe, it will automatically unlock the recipe in the recipe book. To achieve the same effect, you have to use the advancement system and create a new advancement for each of your ingredients. The advancement has to exist. This does not mean it has to be visible in the advancement tree. Type The type of a recipe is specified via the type field. You can think of this as the definition of which recipe layout to use, for example minecraft:crafting_shaped or minecraft:crafting_shapeless . Groups Optionally, you can add a group to your recipes to be displayed within the recipe helper interface. All recipes with the same group string will be shown in the same group. For example, this can be used to have all door recipes shown in the recipe helper interface as a single entry, even though there are different types of doors. Types of crafting recipes Within this section, we will take a closer look on the differences between defining a shaped and a shapeless crafting recipe. Shaped crafting Shaped recipes require the pattern and key keywords. A pattern defines the slot an item must appear in using placeholder characters. You can choose whatever character you want to be a placeholder for an item. The whitespace character is reserved for an empty slot. Keys, on the other hand, define what items to use for the placeholders. A key is defined by a placeholder character and the item. Shapeless crafting A shapeless recipe does not make use of the pattern and key keywords. To define a shapeless recipe, you have to use the ingredients list. It defines which items have to be used for the crafting process. There are many more of these types which can be used here, and you can even register your own. It is even possible to define a slot that requires more than one of an item, which means multiple of these items have to be in place. Note While there is no limit on how many ingredients your recipe requires, the vanilla crafting table only allows 9 items to be placed for each crafting recipe. The following example shows how an ingredient list looks like within JSON: \"ingredients\": [ { \"tag\": \"forge:gems/diamond\" }, { \"item\": \"minecraft:nether_star\" } ], ... Results Every vanilla recipe has to have a result tag to define the output item. When crafting something, you can get out more than one item. This is achieved by defining the count number. If this is left out, meaning it doesn\u2019t exist within the result block, it defaults to 1. Negative values are not allowed here as an ItemStack cannot be smaller than 0. There is no option to use the count number anywhere else than for the result.

Declaring Your Own Groupings Tags are declared in your mod\u2019s datapack . For example, /data/<modid>/tags/blocks/foo/tagname.json will declare an INamedTag<Block> with ID modid:foo/tagname . Similarly, you may append to or override tags declared in other domains, such as Vanilla, by declaring your own JSONs. For example, to add your own mod\u2019s saplings to the Vanilla sapling tag, you would specify it in /data/minecraft/tags/blocks/saplings.json , and Vanilla will merge everything into one tag at reload, if the replace option is false. If replace is true, then all entries before the json specifying replace will be removed. See the Vanilla wiki for a description of the base syntax. Forge provides two extensions on the Vanilla syntax: You may declare an optional array of the same format as the values array, but any values listed here that are not present will not cause the tag loading to error. This has been deprecated in favor of the vanilla method of specifying optional tag values. You may declare a remove array of the same format as the values array. Any values listed here will be removed from the tag. This acts as a finer grained version of the Vanilla replace option.
