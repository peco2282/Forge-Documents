File Structure An example armature file, taken from the forge debug mod { \"joints\": { \"stick\": {\"2\": [1.0]}, \"cube\": {\"3\": [1.0]} }, \"clips\": { \"default\": { \"loop\": true, \"joint_clips\": { \"stick\": [ { \"variable\": \"offset_x\", \"type\": \"uniform\", \"interpolation\": \"linear\", \"samples\": [0, 0.6875, 0] } ], \"cube\": [ { \"variable\": \"offset_x\", \"type\": \"uniform\", \"interpolation\": \"linear\", \"samples\": [0, 0.6875, 0] }, { \"variable\": \"axis_z\", \"type\": \"uniform\", \"interpolation\": \"nearest\", \"samples\": [ 1 ] }, { \"variable\": \"origin_x\", \"type\": \"uniform\", \"interpolation\": \"nearest\", \"samples\": [ 0.15625 ] }, { \"variable\": \"origin_y\", \"type\": \"uniform\", \"interpolation\": \"nearest\", \"samples\": [ 0.40625 ] }, { \"variable\": \"angle\", \"type\": \"uniform\", \"interpolation\": \"linear\", \"samples\": [0, 120, 240, 0, 120, 240] } ] }, \"events\": {} } } } The file is organized in two sections, joints and clips. Joints Each joint defines an object that animates together as a single unit in the animation. With Vanilla JSON models, this means that multiple elements can belong to the same joint. The format is like this: { \"joints\": { <joint>, ... } } --- <joint> ::= { <string>: { // joint name <joint_definition>, ... } } <joint_definition> ::= { \"<index_model>\": [ <float> ] // index_model, joint_weight (only one value expected in array) } joint_name is the name of the joint index_model is a 0-indexed number (where 0 is the first element defined in the model) denoting a model element this joint controls. Must be a string (see example) joint_weight is a weight (0-1) of how much this joint will contribute to the element\u2019s final transformation if the element is used in multiple joints. Note For simpler animations, the weight can usually just be set to 1.0, but if you want multiple joints in a clip to animate differently, this is one way to accomplish that. Not all elements need to have a joint, only the ones you are animating. If an element occurs in multiple joint, the final transform is a weighted average of the transforms for each joint. Clips Clips are essentially instructions on how to use a value to animate some collection of joints. They also include events to fire at certain points. They are formatted like this: { \"clips\": { \"clip_name\": { \"loop\": <true/false>, \"joint_clips\": { <joint_clip_list>, ... }, \"events\": { <event> ... } } } } ------- <joint_clip_list> ::= { \"joint_name\": [ <joint_clip>, ... ] } <joint_clip> ::= { \"variable\": <variable>, \"type\": \"uniform\", \"interpolation\": <interpolation>, \"samples\": [ float, ... ] } loop: if true, the animation will wrap around when the parameter value goes above 1, if not it\u2019ll just clamp at the final state.

These define how the animation is carried out and how to use the clips defined in the armature file. Concepts The ASM contains parameters , clips , states , and transitions . States The Animation State Machine can be in many different states . You define which states there are in the states section. Transitions Transistions define which states are allowed to go to other states, for example allowing a closed state to go to an open state. Note Transitions do not define animations that are played between states, however. If you want to do that you must create an additional state that plays an animation then uses an event to go to the next state. Parameters Note Parameters are called TimeValues in the code, hence the naming convention of SomethingValue. All parameters take an input, usually the current game time in seconds as a float (factoring in partial ticks) and outputs another time. This output is then used as the input to a clip, telling it the current progress of the animation. Each parameter can either be defined in the ASM or when you load the ASM in the code. Load-time parameters are usually of the type VariableValue , which returns a value changeable in-code, ignoring its input. Other types allow you to do math on the input ( SimpleExprValue ), return a constant ( ConstValue ), refer to other parameters ( ParameterValue ), return the input unmodified ( IdentityValue ) and perform composition of two parameters ( CompositionValue ). Clips Note Clips can either be ASM-clips, ones that are defined in the ASM, or armature-clips, ones that are defined in the armature file. For the rest of this page, \u201cclips\u201d will refer to ASM-clips unless otherwise stated. A clip takes in an input, usually the time, and does something to the model with it. Different types of clips do different things, the simplest being animating an armature-clip ( ModelClip ). You can also override the input to another ASM-clip ( TimeClip ), trigger an event while animating another clip if the input is positive ( TriggerClip ), smoothly blend between two clips ( SlerpClip ), refer to another clip in the ASM ( ClipReference ) or do nothing ( IdentityClip ). Events Various things can trigger events in the ASM. Events in the ASM are represented using only text. Some events are special, with text that is formatted like this: !event_type:event_value . Right now there is only one kind of event_type , namely transition . This tries to transition to whatever state is defined in the event_value . Anything else is a normal event and can be used from the pastEvents callback, but more information about that is on the implementing page. Code API Warning The ASM code API can only be used client side . When storing ASMs in code, use the side-agnostic IAnimationStateMachine interface. ASMs can be loaded by calling ModelLoaderRegistry.loadASM . It takes two parameters, the first being a ResourceLocation denoting where the ASM is stored, and second an ImmutableMap of load-time defined parameters. An example: @Nullable private final IAnimationStateMachine asm; private final VariableValue cycle = new VariableValue(4); public Spin() { asm = proxy.loadASM(new ResourceLocation(MODID, \"asms/block/rotatest.json\"), ImmutableMap.of(\"cycle_length\", cycle)); } Here, an ASM is loaded (from a sidedproxy to avoid crashing on server) with one extra parameter, named cycle_length . This parameter is of the type VariableValue , so we can set it from within our code. Using an ASM instance, you can get the current state with .currentState() and transition to another state with .transition(nextState) VariableValue parameters can have their value set by calling .setValue , but you can not read this value back. There is no need to inform the ASM of this change, it happens automatically. File Format The ASMs are stored in json files. The location does not matter, but they are usually placed in an asms folder. First, a simple example: { \"parameters\": { \"anim_cycle\": [\"/\", \"#cycle_length\"] }, \"clips\": { \"default\": [\"apply\", \"forgedebugmodelanimation:block/rotatest@default\", \"#anim_cycle\" ] }, \"states\": [ \"default\" ], \"transitions\": {}, \"start_state\": \"default\" } As stated above, the files have parameters, clips, states and transitions, as well as the starting state of the ASM. All of these tags are required, even if they are empty. Parameters { \"name\": <parameter_definition> } Different types of parameters have different formats for <parameter_definition> , and the simple ones are: IdentityValue : the string #identity , ParameterValue : the parameter to reference, prefixed with # , e.g. #my_awesome_parameter ConstValue : a number to use as the constant to return Mathematical expression ( SimpleExprValue ) Format: [ regex(\"[+\\\\-*/mMrRfF]+\"), <parameter_definition>, ... ] Examples: [ \"+\", 4 ] [ \"/+\", 5, 1] [ \"++\", 2, \"#other\" ] [ \"++\", \"#other\", [ \"compose\", \"#cycle\", 3] ] Explanation The SimpleExprValue takes its input and applies operations to it. The first parameter is the sequence of operations to apply, and the rest represent the operands to those operations. The input to each operation is either the input to this entire parameter (for the first operation) or the result of the previous operation. Operations (case-sensitive): Operator Meaning + output = input + arg - output = input - arg * output = input * arg / output = input / arg m output = min(input, arg) M output = max(input, arg) r output = floor(input / arg) * arg R output = ceil(input / arg) * arg f output = input - floor(input / arg) * arg F output = ceil(input / arg) * arg - input Example explanations: input + 4 (input / 5) + 1 input + 2 + value of parameter other input + value of parameter other + value of parameter cycle given input 3 Function composition ( CompositionValue ) Format: [ \"compose\", <parameter_definition>, <parameter_definition> ] Examples: [ \"compose\", \"#cycle\", 3] [ \"compose\", \"#test\", \"#other\"] [ \"compose\", [ \"+\", 3], \"#other\"] [ \"compose\", [ \"compose\", \"#other2\", \"#other3\"], \"#other\"] Explanation CompositionValue takes two parameter definitions as inputs, and does value1(value2(input)) . In other words, it chains the two inputs, calling the second one with the given input, and the first one with the output of the second one. Example explanations: value of parameter cycle when given input 3 value of parameter test when given the output of parameter other when called with the current input 3 + the output of other with the current input other2(other3(other(input))) because value1 = other2(other3(input)) and value2 = other(input) Clips { \"name\": <clip_definition> } As with parameters, different kinds of clips have different formats for <clip_definition> , but the simple ones are: IdentityClip : the string #identity ClipReference : the clip name prefixed with # , e.g. #my_amazing_clip ModelClip : a model resource location + @ + the name of the armature-clip, e.g. mymod:block/test@default or mymod:block/test#facing=east@moving Overriding input ( TimeClip ) Format: [ \"apply\", <clip_definition>, <parameter_definition> ] Examples: [\"apply\", \"mymod:block/animated_thing@moving\", \"#cycle_time\"] [\"apply\", [ \"apply\", \"mymod:block/animated_thing@moving\", [ \"+\", 3 ] ], \"#cycle\"] Explanation The TimeClip takes another clip and applies it using a custom parameter instead of the current time. Usually used to apply a ModelClip with a parameter instead of the current time. Example explanations: apply the armature-clip for model mymod:block/animated_thing named moving with the output of the parameter cycle_time apply the armature-clip for model mymod:block/animated_thing named moving with 3 + the output of the parameter cycle Triggering an event ( TriggerClip ) Format: [ \"trigger_positive\", <clip_definition>, <parameter_definition>, \"<event_text>\"] Examples [ \"trigger_positive\", \"#default\", \"#end_cycle\", \"!transition:moving\" ] [ \"trigger_positive\", \"mymod:block/animated_thing@moving\", \"#end_cycle\", \"boop\" ] Explanation The TriggerClip visually acts as a TimeClip , but also fires the event in event_text when the parameter_description goes positive. At the same time, it applies the clip in clip_definition with the same parameter_description . Example explanations apply the clip with name default given the input of parameter end_cycle , and when end_cycle is positive transition to the moving state apply the armature-clip mymod:block/animated_thing@moving with parameter end_cycle , and when end_cycle is positive fire event \"boop\" Blend between two clips ( SlerpClip ) Format: [ \"slerp\", <clip_definition>, <clip_definition>, <parameter_definition>, <parameter_definition> ] Examples [ \"slerp\", \"#closed\", \"#open\", \"#identity\", \"#progress\" ] [ \"slerp\", [ \"apply\", \"#move\", \"#mover\"], \"#end\", \"#identity\", \"#progress\" ] Explanation The SlerpClip performs a spherical linear blend between two separate clips. In other words, it will morph one clip into another smoothly. The two clip_definition s are the clips to blend from and to respectively. The first parameter_definition is the \u201cinput\u201d. Both the from and to clips are passed the output of this parameter with the current animation time. The second parameter_definition is the \u201cprogress\u201d, a value between 0 and 1 to denote how far into the blend we are. Combining this clip with trigger_positive and transition special events can allow for simple transitions between two solid states. Example explanations blend the closed clip to the open clip, giving both clips the unaltered time as input and blend progress #progress . blend the result of the move clip when given the input parameter mover to the end clip with the unaltered time as the input with blend progress #progress . States The states section of the file is simply a list of all possible states. For example \"states\": [ \"open\", \"closed\", \"opening\", \"closing\", \"dancing\" ] defines 5 states: open, closed, opening, closing and dancing. Transitions The transitions section defines which states can go to what other states. A state can go to 0, 1, or many other states. To define a state as going to no other states, omit it from the section. To define a state as going to only one other state, create a key with the value of the state it can go to, for example \"open\": \"opening\" . To define a state as going to many other states, do the same as if it were going to only one other state but make the value a list of all possible recieving states instead, for example: \"open\": [\"closed\", \"opening\"] . A more full example: \"transitions\": { \"open\": \"closing\", \"closed\": [ \"dancing\", \"opening\" ], \"closing\": \"closed\", \"opening\": \"open\", \"dancing\": \"closed\" } This example means that: the open state can go to the closing state the closed state can go to either the dancing or opening state the closing state can go to the closed state the opening state can go to the open state the dancing state can go to the closed state","title":"Animation State Machines"},{"location":"animation/asm/#animation-state-machine-files","text":"Animation State Machine (ASM) Files are the meat of the animation API.

Documentation on the ASM API itself (for controlling the animation) is found on the ASM page because it is independent of what you are animating. Blocks Animations for blocks are done with the AnimationTESR , which is a FastTESR . Because of this, having a TileEntity for your block is necessary. Your TileEntity must provide the ANIMATION_CAPABILITY , which is received by calling its .cast method with your ASM. Your block must also render in the ENTITYBLOCK_ANIMATED render layer if you do not provide a StaticProperty in the block\u2019s blockstate. The StaticProperty is a property you can add to your block\u2019s blockstate by adding Properties.StaticProperty to the list of your block\u2019s properties inside of createBlockState() . When rendering the block, the AnimationTESR checks if the property\u2019s value is true; if so, block rendering continues as normal. Otherwise the AnimationTESR animates the block model assigned to the static=false variant in the blockstate json. All parts of the model that can be static should probably be rendered in the static state, as that is its purpose. The handleEvents() callback is located in the AnimationTESR , so you have to either subclass or overload it inline when you register the tileentity. Here\u2019s an example of registering the TESR: ClientRegistry.bindTileEntitySpecialRenderer(Chest.class, new AnimationTESR<Chest>() { @Override public void handleEvents(Chest chest, float time, Iterable<Event> pastEvents) { chest.handleEvents(time, pastEvents); } }); In this example, we\u2019ve overridden the handleEvents() callback when we registered the TESR because the implementation is simple, but you could easily subclass AnimationTESR to achieve the same effect. The handleEvents() callback for blocks takes two arguments: the tile entity being rendered, and an iterable of the events. The call to chest.handleEvents() calls a method located in the fictional Chest TileEntity, as the ASM is not accessible inside of the handleEvents() method. Items Animations for items are done entirely using the capability system. Your item must provide the ANIMATION_CAPABILITY through an ICapabilityProvider . You can create an instance of this capability using its .cast method with your ASM, which is usually stored on the ICapabilityProvider object itself. An example of this is below: private static class ItemAnimationHolder implements ICapabilityProvider { private final VariableValue cycleLength = new VariableValue(4); private final IAnimationStateMachine asm = proxy.load(new ResourceLocation(MODID.toLowerCase(), \"asms/block/engine.json\"), ImmutableMap.<String, ITimeValue>of( \"cycle_length\", cycleLength )); @Override public boolean hasCapability(@Nonnull Capability<?> capability, @Nullable EnumFacing facing) { return capability == CapabilityAnimation.ANIMATION_CAPABILITY; } @Override @Nullable public <T> T getCapability(@Nonnull Capability<T> capability, @Nullable EnumFacing facing) { if(capability == CapabilityAnimation.ANIMATION_CAPABILITY) { return CapabilityAnimation.ANIMATION_CAPABILITY.cast(asm); } return null; } } There is no way to receive events on an item in the current implementation. Entities In order to animate an entity with the animation API, your entity\u2019s renderer must take an AnimationModelBase as its model. This model\u2019s constructor takes two parameters, the location of the actual model to animate (as in the path to the JSON or B3D file, not a blockstate reference) and a VertexLighter . The VertexLighter object can be created with new VertexLighterSmoothAo(Minecraft.getMinecraft().getBlockColors()) .

They make up all of the terrain, structures, and machines. Chances are if you are interested in making a mod, then you will want to add some blocks. This page will guide you through the creation of blocks, and some of the things you can do with them. Creating a Block Basic Blocks For simple blocks, which need no special functionality (think cobblestone, wood planks, etc.), a custom class is not necessary. By simply instantiating the Block class and calling some of the many setters, one can create many different types of blocks. For instance: setHardness - Controls the time it takes to break the block. It is an arbitrary value. For reference, stone has a hardness of 1.5, and dirt 0.5. If the block should be unbreakable, a convenience method setBlockUnbreakable is provided. setResistance - Controls the explosion resistance of the block. This is separate from hardness, but setHardness will also set the resistance to 5 times the hardness value, if the resistance is any lower than this value. setSoundType - Controls the sound the block makes when it is punched, broken, or placed. Requires a SoundType argument, see the sounds page for more details. setLightLevel - Controls the light emission of the block. Note: This method takes a value from zero to one, not zero to fifteen. To calculate this value, take the light level you wish your block to emit and divide by 16. For instance a block which emits level 5 light should pass 5 / 16f to this method. setLightOpacity - Controls the amount light passing through this block will be dimmed. Unlike setLightLevel this value is on a scale from zero to 15. For example, setting this to 3 will lower light by 3 levels every time it passes through this type of block. setUnlocalizedName - Mostly self explanatory, sets the unlocalized name of the block. This name will be prepended with \u201ctile.\u201d and appended with \u201c.name\u201d for localization purposes. For instance setUnlocalizedName(\"foo\") will cause the block\u2019s actual localization key to be \u201ctile.foo.name\u201d. For more advanced localization control, a custom Item will be needed. We\u2019ll get into this more later. setCreativeTab - Controls which creative tab this block will fall under. This must be called if the block should be shown in the creative menu. Tab options can be found in the CreativeTabs class. All these methods are chainable which means you can call them in series. See Block#registerBlocks for examples of this. Advanced Blocks Of course, the above only allows for extremely basic blocks. If you want to add functionality, like player interaction, a custom class is required. However, the Block class has many methods and unfortunately not every single one can be documented here. See the rest of the pages in this section for things you can do with blocks. Registering a Block Blocks must be registered to function. Important A block in the world and a \u201cblock\u201d in an inventory are very different things. A block in the world is represented by an IBlockState , and its behavior defined by an instance of Block . Meanwhile, an item in an inventory is an ItemStack , controlled by an Item . As a bridge between the different worlds of Block and Item , there exists the class ItemBlock . ItemBlock is a subclass of Item that has a field block that holds a reference to the Block it represents. ItemBlock defines some of the behavior of a \u201cblock\u201d as an item, like how a right click places the block. It\u2019s possible to have a Block without an ItemBlock . (E.g. minecraft:water exists a block, but not an item. It is therefore impossible to hold it in an inventory as one.) When a block is registered, only a block is registered. The block does not automatically have an ItemBlock . To create a basic ItemBlock for a block, one should use new ItemBlock(block).setRegistryName(block.getRegistryName()) .

This page will cover the basics of the most common types of interaction with blocks. Player Right Click Since left clicking, or \u201cpunching\u201d, a block does not generally result in any unique behavior, it is probably fair to say right clicking, or \u201cactivation\u201d, is the most common method of interaction. And thankfully, it is also one of the simplest to handle. onBlockActivated This is the method that controls right click behavior, and it is a rather complicated one. Here is its full signature: public boolean onBlockActivated(World worldIn, BlockPos pos, IBlockState state, EntityPlayer playerIn, EnumHand hand, @Nullable ItemStack heldItem, EnumFacing side, float hitX, float hitY, float hitZ) There\u2019s quite a bit to discuss here. Parameters The first few parameters are obvious, they are the current world, position, and state of the block. Next is the player that is activating the block, and the hand with which they are activating. The next parameter, heldItem , is the ItemStack which the player activated the block with. Note that this parameter is @Nullable meaning it can be passed as null (i.e. no item was in the hand). Important The ItemStack passed to this method is the one you should use for checking what was in the player\u2019s hand. Grabbing the currently held stack from the player is unreliable as it may have changed since activation. The last four parameters are all related. side is obviously the side which was activated, however hitX , hitY , and hitZ are a bit less obvious. These are the coordinates of the activation on the block\u2019s bounds. They are on the range 0 to 1, and represent where exactly \u201con\u201d the block the player clicked. Return Value What is this magic boolean which must be returned? Simply put this, is whether or not the method \u201cdid\u201d something. Return true if some action was performed, this will prevent further things from happening, such as item activation. Important Returning false from this method on the client will prevent it being called on the server. It is common practice to just check worldIn.isRemote and return true , and otherwise go on to normal activation logic. Vanilla has many examples of this, such as the chest. Uses The uses for activation are literally endless. However, there are some common ones which deserve their own section. GUIs One of the most common things to do on block activation is opening a GUI. Many blocks in vanilla behave this way, such as chests, hoppers, furnaces, and many more. More about GUIs can be found on their page . Activation Another common use for activation is, well, activation. This can be something like \u201cturning on\u201d a block, or triggering it to perform some action. For instance, a block could light up when activated. A vanilla example would be buttons or levers. Important onBlockActivated is called on both the client and the server, so be sure to keep the sidedness of your code in mind. Many things, like opening GUIs and modifying the world, should only be done on the server-side. Player Break/Destroy Coming Soon Player Highlighting Coming Soon Entity Collision Coming Soon onBlockClicked public void onBlockClicked(World worldIn, BlockPos pos, EntityPlayer playerIn) Called on a block when it is clicked by a player. Note This method is for when the player left-clicks on a block. Don\u2019t get this confused with onBlockActivated , which is called when the player right-clicks . Parameters: Type Name Description World worldIn The world that the block was clicked in BlockPos pos The position of the block that was clicked EntityPlayer playerIn The player who did the clicking Usage example This method is perfect for adding custom events when a player clicks on a block. By default this method does nothing. Two blocks that override this method are the Note Block and the RedstoneOre Block . The Note block overrides this method so that when left-clicked, it plays a sound. The RedstoneOre block overrides method so that when left-clicked, it gives off emits faint light for a few seconds. onBlockDestroyedByPlayer public void onBlockDestroyedByPlayer(World worldIn, BlockPos pos, IBlockState state) Called on a block after it\u2019s destroyed by a player Parameters: Type Name Description World worldIn The world that the block was destroyed BlockPos pos The position of the block that was destroyed IBlockState state The state of the block that was destroyed Warning The pos parameter may not hold the state indicated Usage example This method is perfect for adding custom events as a result of a player destroying a block By default this method does nothing. The TNT Block overrides this method to cause it\u2019s explosion when a player destroys it.

Your understanding will be more comprehensive and correct than if you just picked parts out. This guide is designed for an entry level introduction to Block States. If you know what Extended States are, you\u2019ll notice some simplifying assumptions I\u2019ve made below. They are intentional and are meant to avoid overloading beginners with information they may not immediately need. If you don\u2019t know what they are, no need to fear, there will be another document for them eventually. Motivation In Minecraft 1.8 and above, direct manipulation of blocks and metadata values have been abstracted away into what is known as blockstates. The premise of the system is to remove the usage and manipulation of raw metadata numbers, which are nondescript and carry no meaning. For example, consider this switch statement for some arbitrary block that can face a direction and be on either half of the block space: switch(meta) { case 0: // it's south and on the lower half of the block case 1: // it's south on the upper side of the block case 2: // it's north and on the lower half of the block case 3: // it's north and on the upper half of the block ... etc. } The numbers themselves carry no meaning whatsoever! If the comments weren\u2019t there we would have no idea what the meaning of each number is. A New Way of Thinking How about, instead of having to munge around with numbers everywhere, we instead use some system that abstracts out the details of saving from the semantics of the block itself? This is where IProperty<?> comes in. Each Block has a set of zero or more of these objects, that describe, unsurprisingly, properties that the block have. Examples of this include color ( IProperty<EnumDyeColor> ), facing ( IProperty<EnumFacing> ), integer and boolean values, etc. Each property can have a value of the type parametrized by IProperty . For example, for the respective example properties, we can have values EnumDyeColor.WHITE , EnumFacing.EAST , 1 , or false . Then, following from this, we see that every unique triple (Block, set of properties, set of values for those properties) is a suitable abstracted replacement for Block and metadata. Now, instead of \u201cminecraft:stone_button meta 9\u201d we have \u201cminecraft:stone_button[facing=east,powered=true]\u201d. Guess which is more meaningful? We have a very special name for these triples - they\u2019re called IBlockState \u2018s. Imbuing your Blocks with these Magical Properties Now that I\u2019ve successfully convinced you that properties and values are superior to arbitrary numbers, let\u2019s move on to the actual how-to-do part. In your Block class, create static final IProperty<> objects for every property that your Block has. Vanilla provides us several convenience implementations: PropertyInteger : Implements IProperty<Integer> . Created by calling PropertyInteger.create(\u201c \u201c, , ); PropertyBool : Implements IProperty<Boolean> . Created by calling PropertyBool.create(\u201c \u201c); PropertyEnum<E extends Enum<E>> : Implements IProperty<E> , Defines a property that can take on the values of an Enum class. Created by calling PropertyEnum.create(\u201cname\u201d, ); You can also use only a subset of the Enum values (for example, you can use only 4 of the 16 EnumDyeColor \u2018s. Take a look at the other overloads of PropertyEnum.create ) PropertyDirection : This is a convenience implementation of PropertyEnum<EnumFacing> Several convenience predicates are also provided. For example, to get a property that represents the cardinal directions, you would call PropertyDirection.create(\"<name>\", EnumFacing.Plane.HORIZONTAL) . Or to get the X directions, PropertyDirection.create(\"<name>\", EnumFacing.Axis.X) Note that you are free to make your own IProperty<> implementations, but the means to do that are not covered in this article. In addition, note that you can share the same IProperty object between different blocks if you wish. Vanilla generally has separate ones for every single block, but it is merely personal preference. Note If your mod has an API or is meant to be interacted with from other mods, it is very highly recommended that you instead place your IProperty \u2018s (and any classes used as values) in your API. That way, people can use properties and values to set your blocks in the world instead of having to suffer with arbitrary numbers like you used to. After you\u2019ve created your IProperty<> objects, override createBlockState in your Block class. In that method, simply write return new BlockState() . Pass the BlockState constructor first your Block, this , then follow it with every IProperty you want to declare. Note that in 1.9 and above, the BlockState class has been renamed to BlockStateContainer , more in line with what this class actually does. The object you just created is a pretty magical one - it manages the generation of all the triples above. That is, it generates all possible combinations of every value for each property (for math-oriented people, it takes the set of possible values of each property and computes the cartesian product of those sets). Thus, it generates every unique (Block, properties, values) possible - every IBlockState possible for the given properties. If you do not set one of these IBlockState \u2018s to act as the \u201cdefault\u201d state for your Block, then one is chosen for you. You probably don\u2019t want this (it will cause weird things to happen most of the time), so at the end of your Block\u2019s constructor call setDefaultState() , passing in the IBlockState you want to be the default. Get the one that was chosen for you using this.blockState.getBaseState() then set a value for every property using withProperty Because IBlockState \u2018s are immutable and pregenerated, calling IBlockState.withProperty(<PROPERTY>, <NEW_VALUE>) will simply go to the BlockState / BlockStateContainer and request the IBlockState with the set of values you want, instead of constructing a new IBlockState . It follows very easily from this that since basic IBlockState \u2018s are generated into a fixed set at startup, you are able and encouraged to use reference comparison (==) to check if they are equal! Using IBlockState \u2018s IBlockState , as we know now, is a powerful object. You can get the value of a property by calling getValue(<PROPERTY>) , passing it the IProperty<> you want to test. If you want to get an IBlockState with a different set of values, simply call withProperty(<PROPERTY>, <NEW_VALUE>) as mentioned above. This will return another of the pregenerated IBlockState \u2018s with the values you requested. You can get and put IBlockState \u2018s in the world using setBlockState() and getBlockState() . Illusion Breaker Sadly, abstractions are lies at their core. We still have the responsibility of translating every IBlockState back into a number between 0 and 15 inclusive that will be stored in the world and vice versa for loading. If you declare any IProperty \u2018s, you must override getMetaFromState and getStateFromMeta Here you will read the values of your properties and return an appropriate integer between 0 and 15, or the other way around; the reader is left to check examples from vanilla blocks by themselves. Warning Your getMetaFromState and getStateFromMeta methods must be one to one! In other words, the same set of properties and values must map to the same meta value and back. Failing to do this, unfortunately, won\u2019t cause a crash. It\u2019ll just cause everything to behave extremely weirdly. \u201cActual\u201d States Some sharper minds might know that fences don\u2019t save any of their connections to meta, yet they still have properties and values in the F3 menu! What is this blasphemy?! Blocks can declare properties that are not saved to metadata. These are usually used for rendering purposes, but could possibly have other useful applications. You still declare them in createBlockState and set their value in setDefaultState . However, these properties you do not touch at all in getMetaFromState and getStateFromMeta . Instead, override getActualState in your Block class. Here you will receive the IBlockState corresponding with the metadata in the world, and you return another IBlockState with missing information such as fence connections, redstone connections , etc. filled in using withProperty . You can also use this to read Tile Entity data for a value (with appropriate safety checks of course!). Warning When you read tile entity data in getActualState you must perform additional safety checks. By default, getTileEntity attempts to create the tile entity if it is not already present. However, getActualState and getExtendedState can and will be called from different threads, which can cause the world\u2019s tile entity list to throw a ConcurrentModificationException if it tries to create a missing tile entity. Therefore, you must check if the IBlockAccess argument is a ChunkCache (the object passed to alternate threads), and if so, cast and use the non-writing variant of getTileEntity . An example of this safety check can be found in BlockFlowerPot.getActualState() . Note Querying world.getBlockState() will give you the IBlockState representing only the metadata. Thus the returned IBlockState will not have data from getActualState filled in. If that matters to your code, make sure you call getActualState !

Localization is the process of adapting displayed text to the user\u2019s language. I18n is implemented using translation keys . A translation key is a string that identifies a piece of displayable text in no specific language. For example, tile.dirt.name is the translation key referring to the name of the Dirt block. This way, displayable text may be referenced with no concern for a specific language. The code requires no changes to be adapted in a new language. Localization will happen in the game\u2019s locale. In a Minecraft client the locale is specified by the language settings. On a dedicated server, the only supported locale is en_US. A list of available locales can be found on the Minecraft Wiki . Language files Language files are located by assets/[namespace]/lang/[locale].lang (e.g. the US English translation for examplemod would be assets/examplemod/lang/en_us.lang ). Resource pack format 3 (as specified in pack.mcmeta) requires the locale name to be lowercased. The file format is simply lines of key-value pairs separated by = . Lines starting with # are ignored. Lines without a separator are ignored. The file must be encoded in UTF-8. # items item.examplemod.example_item.name=Example Item Name # blocks tile.examplemod.example_block.name=Example Block Name # commands commands.examplemod.examplecommand.usage=/example <value> Including the comment #PARSE_ESCAPES anywhere in the file will enable the slightly different and more complex Java properties file format. This format is required to support multiline values. Note Enabling #PARSE_ESCAPES changes various aspects of the parsing. Among other things, the : character will be treated as a key-value separator. It must either be excluded from translation keys or escaped using \\: . Usage with Blocks and Items Note As of July 14th 2018, the term \u201cunlocalized name\u201d has been replaced by \u201ctranslation key\u201d in MCP. Block, Item and a few other Minecraft classes have built-in translation keys used to display their names. These translation keys are specified by calling setTranslationKey(String) or by overriding getTranslationKey() . Item also has getTranslationKey(ItemStack) which can be overridden to provide different translation keys depending on ItemStack damage or NBT. By default, getTranslationKey() will return tile. or item. prepended to whatever was set with setTranslationKey(String) , and ItemBlock will inherit the unlocalized name of its Block. Additionally, .name is always appended to the translation key before it is localized. For example item.setTranslationKey(\"examplemod.example_item\") effectively requires the following line in a language file: item.examplemod.example_item.name=Example Item Name Unlike registry names, translation keys are not namespaced. It is therefore highly recommended to prefix your modid somewhere to the translation key (e.g. examplemod.example_item ) to avoid naming conflicts. Otherwise, in the event of a conflict, the localization of one object will override the other. Note The only purpose of a translation key is internationalization. Do not use them for logic. Use registry names instead. A common pattern is using getUnlocalizedName().substring(5) to assign registry names. This is fragile and uses the translation key for logic, which is considered bad practice. Consider setting the registry name first, then setting the translation key according to the registry name using MODID + \".\" + getRegistryName().getResourcePath() . Localization methods Warning A common issue is having the server localize for clients. The server can only localize in its own locale, which does not necessarily match the locale of connected clients. To respect the language settings of clients, the server should have clients localize text in their own locale using TextComponentTranslation or other methods preserving the language neutral translation keys. net.minecraft.client.resources.I18n (client only) This I18n class can only be found on a Minecraft client! It is intended to be used by code that only runs on the client. Attempts to use this on a server will throw exceptions and crash. format(String, Object...) localizes in the client\u2019s locale with formatting. The first parameter is a translation key, and the rest are formatting arguments for String.format(String, Object...) . net.minecraft.util.text.translation.I18n (deprecated) This class is deprecated and should always be avoided. It is intended to be used by code that runs on the logical server. Because localization should rarely happen on the server, other alternatives should be considered. translateToLocal(String) localizes in the game\u2019s locale without formatting. The parameter is a translation key. translateToLocalFormatted(String, Object...) localizes in the game\u2019s locale with formatting. The first parameter is a translation key, and the rest are used as formatting arguments for String.format(String, Object...) . TextComponentTranslation TextComponentTranslation is an ITextComponent that is localized and formatted lazily. It is very useful when sending messages to players because it will be automatically localized in their own locale. The first parameter of the TextComponentTranslation(String, Object...) constructor is a translation key, and the rest are used for formatting. The only supported format specifiers are %s and %1$s , %2$s , %3$s etc. Formatting arguments may be other ITextComponent s that will be inserted into the resulting formatted text with all their attributes preserved. TextComponentHelper createComponentTranslation(ICommandSender, String, Object...) creates a localized and formatted ITextComponent depending on a receiver. The localization and formatting is done eagerly if the receiver is a vanilla client. If not, the localization and formatting is done lazily with a TextComponentTranslation .

Additionally, .name is always appended to the translation key before it is localized. For example item.setTranslationKey(\"examplemod.example_item\") effectively requires the following line in a language file: item.examplemod.example_item.name=Example Item Name Unlike registry names, translation keys are not namespaced. It is therefore highly recommended to prefix your modid somewhere to the translation key (e.g. examplemod.example_item ) to avoid naming conflicts. Otherwise, in the event of a conflict, the localization of one object will override the other. Note The only purpose of a translation key is internationalization. Do not use them for logic. Use registry names instead. A common pattern is using getUnlocalizedName().substring(5) to assign registry names.

Registering things is important, as without registration the game will simply not know about these objects in a mod and will exhibit great amounts of unexplainable behavior (and probably crash). Some examples of things that need to be registered are Block s, Item s, Biome s. Most things that require registration in the game are handled by the Forge registries. A registry is a simple object similar to a map that assigns values to keys. Additionally, they automatically assign integer IDs to values. Forge uses registries with ResourceLocation keys to register objects. This allows the ResourceLocation to act like a \u201cregistry name\u201d for the object. The registry name for an object may be accessed with get / setRegistryName . The setter can only ever be called once, and calling it twice results in an exception. Every type of registrable object has its own registry, and names in two different registries will not collide. (E.g. there\u2019s a registry for Block s, and a registry for Item s, and a Block and an Item may be registered with the same name mod:example without colliding. However, if two blocks were registered with that name, an exception would be thrown.) Registering Things The recommended way to register things is through the RegistryEvent s. These events are fired right after preinitialization, In RegistryEvent.NewRegistry , registries should be created. Later, RegistryEvent.Register is fired once for each registered registry. Because Register is a generic event, the event handler should set the type parameter to the type of the object being registered. The event will contain the registry to register things to ( getRegistry ), and things may be registered with register (or registerAll ) on the registry. Here\u2019s an example of an event handler that registers blocks: @SubscribeEvent public void registerBlocks(RegistryEvent.Register<Block> event) { event.getRegistry().registerAll(block1, block2, ...); } The order in which RegistryEvent.Register events fire is alphabetically, with the exception that Block will always fire first, and Item will always fire second, right after Block . After the Register<Block> event has fired, all ObjectHolder annotations are refreshed, and after Register<Item> has fired they are refreshed again. They are refreshed for a third time after all of the other Register events have fired. RegistryEvent s are currently supported for the following types: Block , Item , Potion , Biome , SoundEvent , PotionType , Enchantment , IRecipe , VillagerProfession , EntityEntry There is another, older way of registering objects into registries, using GameRegistry.register . Anytime something suggests using this method, it should be replaced with an event handler for the appropriate registry event. This method simply finds the registry corresponding to an IForgeRegistryEntry with IForgeRegistryEntry::getRegistryType , and then registers the object to the registry. There is also a convenience overload that takes an IForgeRegistryEntry and a ResourceLocation , which is equivalent to calling IForgeRegistryEntry::setRegistryName , followed by a GameRegistry.register call. Information Registering an Entity might be a little bit confusing at first as it doesn\u2019t use the Entity class, but an EntityEntry . These are created by making use of EntityEntryBuilder . EntityEntryBuilder#id() is equivalent to the setRegistryName() method from IForgeRegistryEntry , with the difference that it also takes a mod internal int ID. A simple counter during registration is enough as this ID is only used for networking. Creating Registries There\u2019s a global registry where all the other registries are stored. By taking a Class that a registry is supposed to store or its ResourceLocation name, one can retrieve a registry from this registry. For example, one can use GameRegistry.findRegistry(Block.class) to get the registry for blocks. Any mod can create their own registries, and any mod can register things to registries from any other mod. Registries are created by using RegistryBuilder inside a RegistryEvent.NewRegistry event handler. This class takes certain parameters for the registry it will generate, such as the name, the Class of it\u2019s values, and various callbacks for when the registry is changed. Upon calling RegistryBuilder::create , the registry is built, registered to the metaregistry, and returned to the caller. In order for a class to have a registry, it needs to implement IForgeRegistryEntry . This interface defines getRegistryName(ResourceLocation) , setRegistryName(ResourceLocation) , and getRegistryType() . getRegistryType is the base Class of the registry the object is to be registered to. It is recommended to extend the default IForgeRegistryEntry.Impl class instead of implementing IForgeRegistryEntry directly. This class also provides two convenience implementations of setRegistryName : one where the parameter is a single string, and one where there are two string parameters. The overload that takes a single string checks whether the input contains a : (i.e. it checks whether the passed in stringified ResourceLocation has a namespace), and if it doesn\u2019t, it uses the current modid as the resource namespace. The two argument overload simply constructs the registry name using the modID as the namespace and name as the path. Injecting Registry Values Into Fields It is possible to have Forge inject values from registries into public static final fields of classes. This is done by annotating classes and fields with @ObjectHolder . If a class has this annotation, all the public static final fields within are taken to be object holders too, and the value of the annotation is the namespace of the holder (i.e. every field uses it as the default namespace for the registry name of the object to inject). If a field has this annotation, and the value does not contain a namespace, the namespace is chosen from the surrounding class\u2019s @ObjectHolder annotation. If the class is not annotated in this situation, the field is ignored with a warning. If it does contain a namespace, then the object to inject into the field is the object with that name. If the class has the annotation and one of the public static final fields does not, then the resource path of the object\u2019s name is taken to be the field\u2019s name. The type of the registry is taken from the type of the field. Note If an object is not found, either because the object itself hasn\u2019t been registered or because the registry does not exist, a debug message is logged and the field is left unchanged. As these rules are rather complicated, here are some examples: @ObjectHolder(\"minecraft\") // Resource namespace \"minecraft\" class AnnotatedHolder { public static final Block diamond_block = null; // public static final is required. // Type Block means that the Block registry will be queried. // diamond_block is the field name, and as the field is not annotated it is taken to be the resource path. // As there is no explicit namespace, \"minecraft\" is inherited from the class. // Object to be injected: \"minecraft:diamond_block\" from the Block registry. @ObjectHolder(\"ender_eye\") public static final Item eye_of_ender = null; // Type Item means that the Item registry will be queried. // As the annotation has the value \"ender_eye\", that overrides the field's name. // As the namespace is not explicit, \"minecraft\" is inherited from the class. // Object to be injected: \"minecraft:ender_eye\" from the Item registry. @ObjectHolder(\"neomagicae:coffeinum\") public static final ManaType coffeinum = null; // Type ManaType means that the ManaType registry will be queried. This is obviously a registry made by a mod. // As the annotation has the value \"neomagicae:coffeinum\", that overrides the field's name. // The namespace is explicit, and is \"neomagicae\", overriding the class's \"minecraft\" default. // Object to be injected: \"neomagicae:coffeinum\" from the ManaType registry. public static final Item ENDER_PEARL = null; // Note that the actual name is \"minecraft:ender_pearl\", not \"minecraft:ENDER_PEARL\". // However, since constructing a ResourceLocation lowercases the value, this will work. } class UnannotatedHolder { // Note lack of annotation on this class. @ObjectHolder(\"minecraft:flame\") public static final Enchantment flame = null; // No annotation on the class means that there is no preset namespace to inherit. // Field annotation supplies all the information for the object. // Object to be injected: \"minecraft:flame\" from the Enchantment registry. public static final Biome ice_flat = null; // No annotation on the class or the field. // Therefore this just gets ignored. @ObjectHolder(\"levitation\") public static final Potion levitation = null; // No resource namespace in annotation, and no default specified by class annotation. // Therefore, THIS WILL FAIL.

After all, a client is what the user interacts with, and a server is where the user connects for a multiplayer game. Easy, right? As it turns out, there can be some ambiguity even with two such terms. Here we disambiguate the four possible meanings of \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d: Physical client - The physical client is the entire program that runs whenever you launch Minecraft from the launcher. All threads, processes, and services that run during the game\u2019s graphical, interactable lifetime are part of the physical client. Physical server - Often known as the dedicated server, the physical server is the entire program that runs whenever you launch any sort of minecraft_server.jar that does not bring up a playable GUI. Logical server - The logical server is what runs game logic: mob spawning, weather, updating inventories, health, AI, and all other game mechanics. The logical server is present within the physical server, but is also can run inside a physical client together with a logical client, as a single player world. The logical server always runs in a thread named the Server Thread . Logical client - The logical client is what accepts input from the player and relays it to the logical server. In addition, it also receives information from the logical server and makes it available graphically to the player. The logical client runs in the Client Thread , though often several other threads are spawned to handle things like audio and chunk render batching. Performing Side-Specific Operations world.isRemote This boolean check will be your most used way to check sides. Querying this field on a World object establishes the logical side the world belongs to. That is, if this field is true , the world is currently running on the logical client. If the field is false , the world is running on the logical server. It follows that the physical server will always contain false in this field, but we cannot assume that false implies a physical server, since this field can also be false for the logical server inside a physical client (in other words, a single player world). Use this check whenever you need to determine if game logic and other mechanics should be run. For example, if you want to damage the player every time they click your block, or have your machine process dirt into diamonds, you should only do so after ensuring world.isRemote is false . Applying game logic to the logical client can cause desynchronization (ghost entities, desynchronized stats, etc.) in the lightest case, and crashes in the worst case. This check should be used as your go-to default. Aside from proxies, rarely will you need the other ways of determining side and adjusting behavior. @SidedProxy Considering the use of a single \u201cuniversal\u201d jar for client and server mods, and the separation of the physical sides into two jars, an important question comes to mind: How do we use code that is only present on one physical side? All code in net.minecraft.client is only present on the physical client, and all code in net.minecraft.server.dedicated is only present on the physical server. If any class you write references those names in any way, they will crash the game when that respective class is loaded in an environment where those names do not exist. A very common mistake in beginners is to call Minecraft.getMinecraft().<doStuff>() in block or tile entity classes, which will crash any physical server as soon as the class is loaded. How do we resolve this? Luckily, FML provides us with a @SidedProxy annotation. We supply it the names of two classes (one for serverSide , one for clientSide ), and decorate a field with this annotation. When the mod starts, FML will instantiate one of the two classes based on the physical side. Note It is important to understand that FML picks the proxy to instantiate based on the physical side. A single player world (logical server + logical client within a physical client) will still have a proxy of the type you specify in clientSide ! A common use case is to register renderers and models, something which must be called from the main initialization methods preInit , init , or postInit . However, many rendering related classes and registries are not present on the physical server and may crash it. Therefore, we put these actions into the client proxy, ensuring that they will always execute for the physical client. Remember that both of your specified proxies must have a type that is assignable into the field you annotate with @SidedProxy . A common pattern, but by no means the only strategy, is to have an interface IProxy as the field type, and then have two implementations, ClientProxy and ServerProxy for the two corresponding physical sides. getEffectiveSide FMLCommonHandler.getEffectiveSide() can be called in order to retrieve the logical side when you do not have access to a World object to check isRemote . It guesses which logical side you are on by looking at the name of the currently running thread. Because it is a guess, this method should only be used when other options have been exhausted. In nearly every case, you should prefer checking world.isRemote to this method call. getSide and @SideOnly FMLCommonHandler.getSide() can be called in order to retrieve the physical side your code is running on. Since it is determined at startup, it does not rely on guessing to return its result. The number of use cases for this method is limited, however. Annotating a method or field with the @SideOnly annotation indicates to the loader that the respective member should be completely stripped out of the definition not on the specified physical side. Usually, these are only seen when browsing through the decompiled Minecraft code, indicating methods that the Mojang obfuscator stripped out. There is little to no reason for using this annotation directly. Only use it if you are overriding a vanilla method that already has @SideOnly defined. In most other cases where you need to dispatch behavior based on physical sides, use @SidedProxy or a check on getSide() instead. Common Mistakes Reaching Across Logical Sides Whenever you want to send information from one logical side to another, you must always use network packets. It is incredibly tempting, when in a single player scenario, to directly transfer data from the logical server to the logical client. This is actually very commonly inadvertently done through static fields. Since the logical client and logical server share the same JVM in a single player scenario, both threads writing to and reading from static fields will cause all sorts of race conditions and the classical issues associated with threading. This mistake can also be made explicitly by accessing physical client-only classes such as Minecraft from common code that runs or can run on the logical server. This mistake is easy to miss for beginners, who debug in a physical client. The code will work there, but will immediately crash on a physical server.","title":"Sides"},{"location":"concepts/sides/#sides-in-minecraft","text":"A very important concept to understand when modding Minecraft are the two sides: client and server .

This is intended to be expanded upon later for more Forge controlled configs. category String \"general\" Root element category. If this is an empty string then the root category is disabled. Important If you disable the root category, this will cause issues unless you create Sub Categories . @Comment Use Adding a @Comment annotation to a field will add a comment to the config in its file. It has 1 property: Property Type Default Value Comment value String[] / String N/A The passed value will be converted to a String[] and for each element of the String[] a new line is added to the comment. Example @Comment({ \"You can add comments using this\", \"and if you supply an array it will be multi-line\" }) public static boolean doTheThing = true; This would produce the following config: # You can add comments using this # and if you supply an array it will be multi-line B:doTheThing=true @Name Use You should use the @Name annotation to give a config a user friendly name in the config file. This has 1 property: Property Type Default Value value String N/A Example @Name(\"FE/T for the thing\") public static int thingFE = 50; This will produce the following config: I:\"FE/T for the thing\"=50 @RangeInt Use You should use @RangeInt to limit an int or Integer config value. It has 2 properties: Property Type Default Value min int Integer.MIN_VALUE max int Integer.MAX_VALUE Example @RangeInt(min = 0) public static int thingFECapped = 50; This will produce the following config: # Min: 0 # Max: 2147483647 I:thingFECapped=50 @RangeDouble Use You should use @RangeDouble to limit a double or Double config value. It has 2 properties: Property Type Default Value min double Double.MIN_VALUE max double Double.MAX_VALUE Example @RangeDouble(min = 0, max = Math.PI) public static double chanceToDrop = 2; This will produce the following config: # Min: 0.0 # Max: 3.141592653589793 D:chanceToDrop=2.0 Note There is not currently (in 1.12.2) a @RangedFloat or @RangedLong or any other variant of the Ranged values. @LangKey Use If you want to add translations for your configs in the mod options menu, add to the config\u2019s field @LangKey .

However, in the case of modding it may be more beneficial to use the format MCVERSION-MAJORMOD.MAJORAPI.MINOR.PATCH , to be able to differentiate between world-breaking and API-breaking changes of a mod. Examples Here is a (most likely incomplete) list of things that increment the various variables. MCVERSION Always matches the Minecraft version the mod is for. MAJORMOD Removing items, blocks, tile entities, etc. Changing or removing previously existing mechanics. Updating to a new Minecraft version. MAJORAPI Changing the order or variables of enums. Changing return types of methods. Removing public methods altogether. MINOR Adding items, blocks, tile entities, etc. Adding new mechanics. Deprecating public methods. (This is not a MAJORAPI increment since it doesn\u2019t break an API.) PATCH Bugfixes. When incrementing any variable, all lesser variables should reset to 0 . For instance, if MINOR would increment, PATCH would become 0 . If MAJORMOD would increment, all other variables would become 0 . Work In Progress If you are in the initial development stage of your mod (before any official releases), the MAJORMOD and MAJORAPI should always be 0 . Only MINOR should be updated every time you build your mod. Once you build an official release (most of the time with a stable API), you should increment MAJORMOD to version 1.0.0.0 . For any further development stages, refer to the Prereleases and Release candidates section of this document. Multiple Minecraft Versions If the mod upgrades to a new version of Minecraft, and the old version will only receive bug fixes, the PATCH variable should be updated based on the version before the upgrade.

In general terms, each capability provides a feature in the form of an interface, alongside with a default implementation which can be requested, and a storage handler for at least this default implementation. The storage handler can support other implementations, but this is up to the capability implementor, so look it up in their documentation before trying to use the default storage with non-default implementations. Forge adds capability support to TileEntities, Entities, ItemStacks, Worlds and Chunks, which can be exposed either by attaching them through an event or by overriding the capability methods in your own implementations of the objects. This will be explained in more detail in the following sections. Forge-provided Capabilities Forge provides three capabilities: IItemHandler, IFluidHandler and IEnergyStorage IItemHandler exposes an interface for handling inventory slots. It can be applied to TileEntities (chests, machines, etc.), Entities (extra player slots, mob/creature inventories/bags), or ItemStacks (portable backpacks and such). It replaces the old IInventory and ISidedInventory with an automation-friendly system. IFluidHandler exposes an interface for handling fluid inventories. It can also be applied to TileEntities Entities, or ItemStacks. It replaces the old IFluidHandler with a more consistent and automation-friendly system. IEnergyStorage exposes an interface for handling energy containers. It can be applied to TileEntities, Entities or ItemStacks. It is based on the RedstoneFlux API by TeamCoFH. Using an Existing Capability As mentioned earlier, TileEntities, Entities, and ItemStacks implement the capability provider feature, through the ICapabilityProvider interface. This interface adds two methods, hasCapability and getCapability , which can be used to query the capabilities present in the objects. In order to obtain a capability, you will need to refer it by its unique instance. In the case of the Item Handler, this capability is primarily stored in CapabilityItemHandler.ITEM_HANDLER_CAPABILITY , but it is possible to get other instance references by using the @CapabilityInject annotation. @CapabilityInject(IItemHandler.class) static Capability<IItemHandler> ITEM_HANDLER_CAPABILITY = null; This annotation can be applied to fields and methods. When applied to a field, it will assign the instance of the capability (the same one gets assigned to all fields) upon registration of the capability, and left to the existing value ( null ), if the capability was never registered. Because local static field accesses are fast, it is a good idea to keep your own local copy of the reference for objects that work with capabilities. This annotation can also be used on a method, in order to get notified when a capability is registered, so that certain features can be enabled conditionally. Both the hasCapability and getCapability methods have a second parameter, of type EnumFacing, which can be used in the to request the specific instance for that one face. If passed null , it can be assumed that the request comes either from within the block, or from some place where the side has no meaning, such as a different dimension. In this case a general capability instance that does not care about sides will be requested instead. The return type of getCapability will correspond to the type declared in the capability passed to the method. For the Item Handler capability, this is indeed IItemHandler . Exposing a Capability In order to expose a capability, you will first need an instance of the underlying capability type. Note that you should assign a separate instance to each object that keeps the capability, since the capability will most probably be tied to the containing object. There\u2019s two ways to obtain such an instance, through the Capability itself, or by explicitly instantiating an implementation of it. The first method is designed to use a default implementation, if those default values are useful for you. In the case of the Item Handler capability, the default implementation will expose a single slot inventory, which is most probably not what you want. The second method can be used to provide custom implementations. In the case of IItemHandler , the default implementation uses the ItemStackHandler class, which has an optional argument in the constructor, to specify a number of slots. However, relying on the existence of these default implementations should be avoided, as the purpose of the capability system is to prevent loading errors in contexts where the capability is not present, so instantiation should be protected behind a check testing if the capability has been registered (see the remarks about @CapabilityInject in the previous section). Once you have your own instance of the capability interface, you will want to notify users of the capability system that you expose this capability. This is done by overriding the hasCapability method, and comparing the instance with the capability you are exposing. If your machine has different slots based on which side is being queried, you can test this with the facing parameter. For Entities and ItemStacks, this parameter can be ignored, but it is still possible to have side as a context, such as different armor slots on a player (top side => head slot?), or about the surrounding blocks in the inventory (west => slot on the left?). Don\u2019t forget to fall back to super , otherwise the attached capabilities will stop working. @Override public boolean hasCapability(Capability<?> capability, EnumFacing facing) { if (capability == CapabilityItemHandler.ITEM_HANDLER_CAPABILITY) { return true; } return super.hasCapability(capability, facing); } Similarly, you will want to provide the interface reference to your capability instance, when requested. Again, don\u2019t forget to fall back to super . @Override public <T> T getCapability(Capability<T> capability, EnumFacing facing) { if (capability == CapabilityItemHandler.ITEM_HANDLER_CAPABILITY) { return (T) inventory; } return super.getCapability(capability, facing); } It is strongly suggested that direct checks in code are used to test for capabilities instead of attempting to rely on maps or other data structures, since capability tests can be done by many objects every tick, and they need to be as fast as possible in order to avoid slowing down the game. Attaching Capabilities As mentioned, attaching capabilities to entities and itemstacks can be done using AttachCapabilitiesEvent . The same event is used for all objects that can provide capabilities. AttachCapabilitiesEvent has 5 valid generic types providing the following events: AttachCapabilitiesEvent<Entity> : Fires only for entities. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<TileEntity> : Fires only for tile entities. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<ItemStack> : Fires only for item stacks. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<World> : Fires only for worlds. AttachCapabilitiesEvent<Chunk> : Fires only for chunks. The generic type cannot be more specific than the above types. For example: If you want to attach capabilities to EntityPlayer , you have to subscribe to the AttachCapabilitiesEvent<Entity> , and then determine that the provided object is an EntityPlayer before attaching the capability. In all cases, the event has a method addCapability , which can be used to attach capabilities to the target object. Instead of adding capabilities themselves to the list, you add capability providers, which have the chance to return capabilities only from certain sides. While the provider only needs to implement ICapabilityProvider , if the capability needs to store data persistently it is possible to implement ICapabilitySerializable<T extends NBTBase> which, on top of returning the capabilities, will allow providing NBT save/load functions. For information on how to implement ICapabilityProvider , refer to the Exposing a Capability section. Creating Your Own Capability In general terms, a capability is declared and registered through a single method call to CapabilityManager.INSTANCE.register() . One possibility is to define a static register() method inside a dedicated class for the capability, but this is not required by the capability system. For the purpose of this documentation we will be describing each part as a separate named class, although anonymous classes are an option. CapabilityManager.INSTANCE.register(capability interface class, storage, default implementation factory); The first parameter to this method, is the type that describes the capability feature. In our example, this will be IExampleCapability.class . The second parameter is an instance of a class that implements Capability.IStorage<T> , where T is the same class we specified in the first parameter. This storage class will help manage saving and loading for the default implementation, and it can, optionally, also support other implementations. private static class Storage implements Capability.IStorage<IExampleCapability> { @Override public NBTBase writeNBT(Capability<IExampleCapability> capability, IExampleCapability instance, EnumFacing side) { // return an NBT tag } @Override public void readNBT(Capability<IExampleCapability> capability, IExampleCapability instance, EnumFacing side, NBTBase nbt) { // load from the NBT tag } } The last parameter is a callable factory that will return new instances of the default implementation. private static class Factory implements Callable<IExampleCapability> { @Override public IExampleCapability call() throws Exception { return new Implementation(); } } Finally, we will need the default implementation itself, to be able to instantiate it in the factory. Designing this class is up to you, but it should at least provide a basic skeleton that people can use to test the capability, if it\u2019s not a fully usable implementation on itself. Persisting Chunk and TileEntity capabilities Unlike Worlds, Entities and ItemStacks, Chunks and TileEntities are only written to disk when they have been marked as dirty. A capability implementation with persistent state for a Chunk or a TileEntity should therefore ensure that whenever its state changes, its owner is marked as dirty. ItemStackHandler , commonly used for inventories in TileEntities, has an overridable method void onContentsChanged(int slot) designed to be used to mark the TileEntity as dirty. public class MyTileEntity extends TileEntity { private final IItemHandler inventory = new ItemStackHandler(...) { @Override protected void onContentsChanged(int slot) { super.onContentsChanged(slot); markDirty(); } } ... } Synchronizing Data with Clients By default, Capability data is not sent to clients. In order to change this, the mods have to manage their own synchronization code using packets. There are three different situation in which you may want to send synchronization packets, all of them optional: When the entity spawns in the world, or the block is placed, you may want to share the initialization-assigned values with the clients. When the stored data changes, you may want to notify some or all of the watching clients. When a new client starts viewing the entity or block, you may want to notify it of the existing data. Refer to the Networking page for more information on implementing network packets. Persisting across Player Deaths By default, the capability data does not persist on death. In order to change this, the data has to be manually copied when the player entity is cloned during the respawn process. This can be done by handling the PlayerEvent.Clone event, reading the data from the original entity, and assigning it to the new entity. In this event, the wasDead field can be used to distinguish between respawning after death, and returning from the End. This is important because the data will already exist when returning from the End, so care has to be taken to not duplicate values in this case. Migrating from IExtendedEntityProperties Although the Capability system can do everything IEEPs (IExtendedEntityProperties) did and more, the two concepts don\u2019t fully match 1:1. In this section, I will explain how to convert existing IEEPs into Capabilities. This is a quick list of IEEP concepts and their Capability equivalent: Property name/id ( String ): Capability key ( ResourceLocation ) Registration ( EntityConstructing ): Attaching ( AttachCapabilitiesEvent<Entity> ), the real registration of the Capability happens during pre-init. NBT read/write methods: Does not happen automatically. Attach an ICapabilitySerializable in the event, and run the read/write methods from the serializeNBT / deserializeNBT . Features you probably will not need (if the IEEP was for internal use only): The Capability system provides a default implementation concept, meant to simplify usage by third party consumers, but it doesn\u2019t really make much sense for an internal Capability designed to replace an IEEP. You can safely return null from the factory if the capability is be for internal use only. The Capability system provides an IStorage system that can be used to read/write data from those default implementations, if you choose not to provide default implementations, then the IStorage system will never get called, and can be left blank. The following steps assume you have read the rest of the document, and you understand the concepts of the capability system. Quick conversion guide: Convert the IEEP key/id string into a ResourceLocation (which will use your MODID as a namespace). In your handler class (not the class that implements your capability interface), create a field that will hold the Capability instance. Change the EntityConstructing event to AttachCapabilitiesEvent , and instead of querying the IEEP, you will want to attach an ICapabilityProvider (probably ICapabilitySerializable , which allows saving/loading from NBT). Create a registration method if you don\u2019t have one (you may have one where you registered your IEEP\u2019s event handlers) and in it, run the capability registration function.","title":"Capabilities"},{"location":"datastorage/capabilities/#the-capability-system","text":"Capabilities allow exposing features in a dynamic and flexible way, without having to resort to directly implementing many interfaces.

Warning This system has been deprecated in favor of the Capability system. Declaration and Registration The basis of the EEPs is the IExtendedEntityProperties interface. This interface provides the basic methods required for managing the extended data: init : Allows the implementation to have knowledge about the entity it\u2019s attached to, and the world this entity is loaded into. saveNBTData : Allows the implementation to store data in the save file, to be loaded when the entity gets loaded into the world. loadNBTData : Allows the implementation to read the previously saved data for this entity. An implementation will have a class implementing this interface, and instances of this class will be attached to the entities, ready to store any required data. The implementation will need to make use of events in order to attach the IEEP to entities, and optionally any other required features. To help with encapsulation, you may want to create an inner class for handling those events. In the example, I created a register() method to help with that. A basic skeleton to get started: public class ExampleEntityProperty implements IExtendedEntityProperties { public static final String PROP_NAME = ExampleMod.MODID + \"_ExampleEntityData\"; public static void register() { MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(new Handler()); } // IExtendedEntityProperties methods go here public static class Handler { // Event handlers will go here } } Attaching the Implementation to Entities In order to attach the extended property to an entity, it is done by handling the EntityEvent.EntityConstructing event, and if the entity is of interest, using the Entity#registerExtendedProperties method. In order to uniquely identify your property and avoid duplication, the method takes a string parameter with an identifier for the property. A good practice is to include the modid in this string, so that it will not collide with other mods. Warning If the same property identifier is added twice, Forge will append a number to it, and return this modified identifier from the registerExtendedProperties method. If you don\u2019t want that to happen, you can use Entity#getExtendedProperties to check if an IEEP with that name was already added. In order to handle this event, you could do something like this: @SubscribeEvent public void entityConstruct(EntityEvent.EntityConstructing e) { if (e.entity instanceof EntityPlayer) { if (e.entity.getExtendedProperties(PROP_NAME) == null) { e.entity.registerExtendedProperties(PROP_NAME, new ExampleEntityProperty()); } } } Making Use of the Implementation To make use of the extended data, the instance of the IEEP implementation has to be obtained from the Entity, and because the entity could have been unloaded or may have changed dimensions, it is not safe to cache the references. To obtain the IEEP reference, one would use Entity#getExtendedProperties , with the same property ID specified on registration. The return value, if not null , is the instance of IExtendedEntityProperties added during entity construction. A good idea is to create a static get method in your IEEP implementation, that will automatically obtain the instance, and cast it to your implementation class. It can be as simple as: public static ExampleEntityProperty get(Entity p) { return (ExampleEntityProperty) p.getExtendedProperties(PROP_NAME); } Saving and Loading Data from NBT Forge allows all IEEPs attached to an entity to save and load themselves. However, keep in mind that the NBT tag provided in the saveNBTData and loadNBTData methods is a global tag for the entity, and may contain data for other IEEPs, along with all the data from the entity itself. There are some cases where an IEEP may benefit from accessing this global data, but for the most common use cases, it is important to avoid colliding with existing data, preferably by storing the data in a nested tag, using an unique name for it (such as the name used to identify the IEEP). Your code may look a bit like this: @Override public void saveNBTData(NBTTagCompound compound) { NBTTagCompound propertyData = new NBTTagCompound(); // Write data to propertyData compound.setTag(PROP_NAME, propertyData); } @Override public void loadNBTData(NBTTagCompound compound) { if(compound.hasKey(PROP_NAME, Constants.NBT.TAG_COMPOUND)) { NBTTagCompound propertyData = compound.getCompoundTag(PROP_NAME); // Read data from propertyData } } Synchronizing Data with Clients By default, the entity data is not sent to clients. In order to change this, the mods have to manage their own synchronization code using packets. There are three different situation in which you may want to send synchronization packets, all of them optional: When the entity spawns in the world, you may want to share the initialization-assigned values with the clients. When the stored data changes, you may want to notify some or all of the watching clients. When a new client starts viewing the entity, you may want to notify it of the existing data. Refer to the Networking page for more information on implementing the network packets. For example: private void dataChanged() { if(!world.isRemote) { EntityTracker tracker = ((WorldServer)world).getEntityTracker(); ExampleEntityPropertySync message = new ExampleEntityPropertySync(this); for (EntityPlayer entityPlayer : tracker.getTrackingPlayers(entity)) { ExampleMod.channel.sendTo(message, (EntityPlayerMP)entityPlayer); } } } private void entitySpawned() { dataChanged(); } private void playerStartedTracking(EntityPlayer entityPlayer) { ExampleMod.channel.sendTo(new ExampleEntityPropertySync(this), (EntityPlayerMP)entityPlayer); } And the corresponding event handlers: @SubscribeEvent public void entityJoinWorld(EntityJoinWorldEvent e) { ExampleEntityProperty data = ExampleEntityProperty.get(e.entity); if (data != null) data.entitySpawned(); } @SubscribeEvent public void playerStartedTracking(PlayerEvent.StartTracking e) { ExampleEntityProperty data = ExampleEntityProperty.get(e.target); if (data != null) data.playerStartedTracking(e.entityPlayer); } Persisting across Player Deaths By default, the entity data does not persist on death. In order to change this, the data has to be manually copied when the player entity is cloned during the respawn process. This can be done by handling the PlayerEvent.Clone event. In this event, the wasDead field can be used to distinguish between respawning after death, and returning from the End. This is important because the data will already exist, so care has to be taken to not duplicate values when returning from the End dimension. @SubscribeEvent public void onClonePlayer(PlayerEvent.Clone e) { if(e.wasDeath) { NBTTagCompound compound = new NBTTagCompound(); ExampleEntityProperty.get(e.original).saveNBTData(compound); ExampleEntityProperty.get(e.entityPlayer).loadNBTData(compound); } }","title":"Extended Entity Properties"},{"location":"datastorage/extendedentityproperties/#extended-entity-properties","text":"Extended entity properties allow attaching data to entities.

Example: An event can be used to perform an action when a Vanilla stick is right clicked. The main event bus used for most events is located at MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS . There are also a few other buses used for specific types of events (like terrain generation) located in the same class. An event handler is a class that contains one or more public void member methods that are marked with the @SubscribeEvent annotation. Creating an Event Handler public class MyForgeEventHandler { @SubscribeEvent public void pickupItem(EntityItemPickupEvent event) { System.out.println(\"Item picked up!\"); } } This event handler listens for the EntityItemPickupEvent , which is, as the name states, posted to the event bus whenever an Entity picks up an item. To register this event handler, use MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register() and pass it an instance of your event handler class. Note In older forge versions, there were two separate event buses. One for forge, one for FML. This has long since been deprecated, so there is no need to use the FML event bus any longer. Static Event Handlers An event handler may also be static. The handling method is still annotated with @SubscribeEvent and the only difference from an instance handler is that it is also marked static . In order to register a static event handler, an instance of the class won\u2019t do, the Class itself has to be passed in. An example: public class MyStaticForgeEventHandler { @SubscribeEvent public static void arrowNocked(ArrowNockEvent event) { System.out.println(\"Arrow nocked!\"); } } which must be registered like this: MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(MyStaticForgeEventHandler.class) . Automatically Registering Static Event Handlers A class may be annotated with the @Mod.EventBusSubscriber annotation. Such a class is automatically registered to MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS when the @Mod class itself is constructed. This is essentially equivalent to adding MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(AnnotatedClass.class); at the end of the @Mod class\u2019s constructor. Note This does not register an instance of the class; it registers the class itself (i.e. the event handling methods must be static). Canceling If an event can be canceled, it will be marked with the @Cancelable annotation, and the method Event#isCancelable() will return true . The cancel state of a cancelable event may be modified by calling Event#setCanceled(boolean canceled) , wherin passing the boolean value true is interpreted as canceling the event, and passing the boolean value false is interpreted as \u201cun-canceling\u201d the event. However, if the event cannot be canceled (as defined by Event#isCancelable() ), an UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown regardless of the passed boolean value, since the cancel state of a non-cancelable event event is considered immutable. Important Not all events can be canceled! Attempting to cancel an event that is not cancelable will result in an unchecked UnsupportedOperationException being thrown, which is expected to result in the game crashing! Always check that an event can be canceled using Event#isCancelable() before attempting to cancel it! Results Some events have an Event.Result , a result can be one of three things, DENY which stops the event, DEFAULT which uses the Vanilla behavior, and ALLOW which forces the action to take place, regardless if it would have originally. The result of an event can be set by calling setResult with an Event.Result on the event. Not all events have results, an event with a result will be annotated with @HasResult . Important Different events may use results in different ways, refer to the event\u2019s JavaDoc before using the result. Priority Event handler methods (marked with @SubscribeEvent ) have a priority. You can set the priority of an event handler method by setting the priority value of the annotation.

To register this event handler, use MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register() and pass it an instance of your event handler class. Note In older forge versions, there were two separate event buses.

A simple mod development environment won\u2019t suffice to work with Forge\u2019s codebase directly. Instead, you can use the following guide to help you with your setup and get you started with improving Forge! Forking and Cloning the Repository Like most major open source projects you\u2019ll find, Forge is hosted on GitHub . If you\u2019ve contributed to another project before, you\u2019ll know this process already and you can skip right ahead to the next section. For those who are beginners when it comes to collaboration via Git, here are only two easy to steps to get you started. Note This guide assumes that you already have a GitHub account set up. If you don\u2019t, visit their registration page to create an account. Furthermore, this guide is not a tutorial for git\u2019s usage, please consult different sources first if you\u2019re struggling with getting it working. Forking First of all, you have to \u201cfork\u201d the MinecraftForge repository by clicking the \u201cFork\u201d button in the upper right hand corner. If you are in an organization, select the account you want your fork to be hosted on. Forking the repository is necessary since not every GitHub user can have free access to every repository. Instead, you create a copy of the original repository to later contribute your changes via a so called Pull Request, which you will learn more about later. Cloning After forking the repository, it is time to get local access to it and to actually make some changes. For this, you need to clone the repository onto your local machine. Using your favourite git client, simply clone your fork into a directory of your choice. As general example, here is a command line snippet that should work on all correctly configured systems and clones the repository into a directory called \u201cForge\u201d under the current directory (note that you have to replace <User> with your username): git clone https://github.com/<User>/MinecraftForge Forge Checking out the Correct Branch Forking and cloning the repository are the only mandatory steps to develop for Forge. However, to ease the process of creating Pull Requests for you, it is best to work with branches. It is recommended to create and check out a branch for each PR you plan to submit. This way, you can always keep around the latest changes of Forge for new PRs while you still work on older patches. After completing this step, you\u2019re ready to go and set up your development environment. Setting Up the Environment Depending on your favourite IDE, there is a different set of recommended steps you have to follow to successfully set up a development environment. Eclipse Due to the way eclipse workspaces work, ForgeGradle can do most of the work involved in getting you started with a Forge workspace for you. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate it to the directory of your cloned fork. Type ./gradlew setupForge and hit enter. Wait until ForgeGradle is done. Open your eclipse workspace and go to File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into workspace . Browse to the <repo>/projects/ directory for the root directory in the dialog that opens. Make sure both \u201cForge\u201d and \u201cClean\u201d are checked and adjust the other settings to your liking. Complete the import by clicking the \u201cFinish\u201d button. That\u2019s all it takes to get you up and running with Eclipse, there\u2019s no extra steps required to get test mods running. Simply hit Run like in any other project and select the appropriate run configuration. IntelliJ IDEA JetBrains\u2019 flagship IDE comes with great integrated support for Gradle , Forge\u2019s build system of choice. Due to some peculiarities of Minecraft mod development, however, there are additional steps required to get everything to work properly. If you\u2019re more of a visual person, cpw has uploaded a video explaining very similar steps which will also lead to a working setup. Note These steps will only work reliably from IDEA version 2016 onwards. Older versions didn\u2019t have the appropriate Gradle support and did not support Forge development workspaces. Import Forge\u2019s build.gradle as an IDEA project. For this, simply click File -> Open , then navigate to your fork\u2019s clone and select the build.gradle file. If a dialog pops up, select \u201cOpen as Project\u201d. In the wizard that follows, make sure that \u201cCreate separate module per source set\u201d is checked and that the \u201cUse default gradle wrapper\u201d option is active. Confirm the dialog. After IDEA is done importing the project and indexing the files, open the Gradle sidebar on the right hand side of your screen Open the \u201cforge\u201d project tree, select \u201cTasks\u201d, then \u201cforgegradle\u201d and right click the \u201cCreate Forge [setup]\u201d option Once the configuration dialog shows up, edit the \u201ctasks\u201d field to contain clean setup and add -Xmx3G -Xms3G to \u201cVM Options\u201d. The latter option ensures that the resource intensive decompilation process has enough memory. Click \u201cOkay\u201d and run your newly created run configuration. This may take a while. After the setup task has completed, go once again to the Gradle sidebar and click the \u201cAttach Gradle project\u201d button (the plus icon) at the top Navigate to your clone\u2019s directory, then open the projects directory and double click the build.gradle file in there. Select \u201cUse gradle wrapper task configuration\u201d in the following dialog and confirm it. Import all modules IDEA suggests To get access to the project\u2019s run configurations, open the projects directory in your file explorer and navigate to the .idea directory (might be hidden depending on your system). Copy the runConfigurations directory into .idea under your fork\u2019s root directory Once IDEA recognizes the added configurations, complete the following steps for each one Change the configuration\u2019s module to <Config>_main where <Config> is the first part of the configuration\u2019s name Change the run directory to <clone>/projects/run That\u2019s all there is to creating a Forge development environment in IntelliJ IDEA. However, you won\u2019t be able to run the tests and debug mods included in Forge straight away. This takes some extra effort. Enabling test mods To enable the test mods coming with Forge, you will need to add the compiler output to the classpath. Again, cpw has put up a video explaining these steps. Build the test classes by selecting the src/main/test directory in your project view and then run Build -> Build module 'Forge_test' from the menu bar. Open the \u201cProject Structure\u201d Window under File -> Project Structure . Head to the \u201cModules\u201d section and expand the Forge module. Select the Forge_test submodule and head to the \u201cPaths\u201d tab. Remember the path listed under the \u201cTest output path\u201d label and select the Forge_main submodule from the tree. Open the \u201cDependencies\u201d tab, hit the green plus button on the right-hand side and select \u201cJARs or directories\u201d. Navigate to the path previously displayed as the Forge_test output path and confirm your selection. For the \u201cScope\u201d of this newly added dependency (currently \u201cCompile\u201d) choose \u201cRuntime\u201d, since the main code doesn\u2019t rely on the test code for compilation. Now that you\u2019ve added the test mods to the classpath, you need to rebuild them each time you make a change as they will not be built automatically. To do so, repeat step 1 from the above list or, in case you make changes to a single test mod file and want them to get rebuild, simply hit Build -> Rebuild project or the corresponding keyboard shortcut ( CTRL + F9 by default). Testing with existing mods You might want to test changes in Forge with an existing project. The video by cpw linked in the test mods section also covers this. Getting the mod to run requires similar steps to the test mod, but getting your project added to the workspace requires some additional work. Open the \u201cProject Structure\u201d Window under File -> Project Structure . Head to the \u201cModules\u201d section and press the green plus icon above the tree view. Select \u201cImport Module\u201d, navigate to your project\u2019s build.gradle file and confirm your selection as well as the import settings. Close the \u201cProject Structure\u201d window by clicking the \u201cOK\u201d button. Reopen the window after IDEA is done importing the project and select your project\u2019s _main module from the tree. Open the \u201cDependencies\u201d tab, click the green plus icon on the right-hand side and select \u201cModule dependency\u201d. In the window that just opened, select the Forge_main module. From here on, reproduce the steps from the test mods section, just with your project\u2019s _main module instead of the Forge_test one. Note You might need to remove existing dependencies from a normal development environment (mainly references to a forgeSrc JAR) or move the Forge module higher up in the dependency list. You should now be able to work with your mod using the changes you introduce to the Forge and Vanilla codebase. Making Changes and Pull Requests Once you\u2019ve set up your development environment, it\u2019s time to make some changes to Forge\u2019s codebase. There are, however, some pitfalls you have to avoid when editing the project\u2019s code. The most important thing to note is that if you wish to edit Minecraft source code, you must only do so in the \u201cForge\u201d sub-project. Any changes in the \u201cClean\u201d project will mess with ForgeGradle and generating the patches. This can have disastrous consequences and might render your environment completely useless. If you wish to have a flawless experience, make sure you only edit code in the \u201cForge\u201d project! Generating Patches After you\u2019ve made changes to the code base and once you\u2019ve tested them thoroughly, you may go ahead and generate patches. This is only necessary if you work on the Minecraft code base (i.e. in the \u201cForge\u201d project), but this step is vital for your changes to work elsewhere. Forge works by injecting only changed things into Vanilla Minecraft and hence needs those changes available in an appopriate format. Thankfully, ForgeGradle is capable of generating the changeset for you and all you have to do is commit it. To initiate the patch generation, simply run the genPatches Gradle task from your IDE or the command line. After its completion, you can commit all your changes (make sure you do not add any unnecessary files) and submit your Pull Request! Pull Requests The last step before your contribution is added to Forge is a Pull Request (PR in short). This is a formal request to incorporate your fork\u2019s changes into the live code base. Creating a PR is easy, simply go to this GitHub page and follow the proposed steps. It is now that a good setup with branches pays off, since you\u2019re able to select precisely the changes you want to submit. Note Pull Requests are bound to rules, not every request will blindly be accepted. Follow this document to get further information and to ensure the best quality of your PR!

When modders run into something like that, they can make a change to Forge to support it, and submit that change as a Pull Request on Github. To make the best use of both your and the Forge team\u2019s time, it is recommended to follow some rough guidelines when preparing a Pull Request. The following points are the most important aspects to keep in mind when it comes to writing a good Pull Request. What Exactly is Forge? At a high level, Forge is a mod compatibility layer on top of Minecraft. Early mods edited Minecraft\u2019s code directly (like coremods do now), but ran into conflicts with each other when they edited the same things. They also ran into issues when one mod changed behavior in ways that the other mods could not anticipate (like coremods do now), causing mysterious issues and lots of headaches. By using something like Forge, mods can centralize common changes and avoid conflicts. Forge also includes supporting structures for common mod features like Capabilities, Registries, Fluid handling, the Ore Dictionary, and others that allow mods to work together better. When writing a good Forge Pull Request, you also have to know what Forge is at a lower level. There are two main types of code in Forge: Minecraft patches, and Forge code. Patches Patches are applied as direct changes to Minecraft\u2019s source code, and aim to be as minimal as possible. Every time Minecraft code changes, all the Forge patches need to be looked over carefully and applied correctly to the new code. This means that large patches that change lots of things are difficult to maintain, so Forge aims to avoid those and keep patches as small as possible. In addition to making sure the code makes sense, reviews for patches will focus on minimizing the size. There are many strategies to make small patches, and reviews will often point out better methods to do things. Forge patches often insert a single line that fires an event or a code hook, which affects the code after it if the event meets some condition. This allows most of the code to exist outside of the patch, which keeps the patch small and simple. For more detailed information about creating patches, see the GitHub wiki . Forge Code Aside from the patches, Forge code is just normal Java code. It can be event code, compatibility features, or anything else that\u2019s not directly editing Minecraft code. When Minecraft updates, Forge code has to update just like everything else. However, it\u2019s much easier because it is not directly entangled in the Minecraft code. Because this code stands on its own, there is no size restriction like there is with the patches. In addition to making sure the code makes sense, reviews for this code will focus on making the code clean, with proper formatting and Java documentation. Explain Yourself All Pull Requests need to answer the question: why is this necessary? Any code added to Forge needs to be maintained, and more code means more potential for bugs, so solid justification is needed for adding code. A common Pull Request issue is offering no explanation, or giving cryptic examples for how the Pull Request might theoretically be used. This only delays the Pull Request process. A clear explanation for the general case is good, but also give a concrete example of how your mod needs this Pull Request. Sometimes there is better way to do what you wanted, or a way to do it without a Pull Request at all. Code changes can not be accepted until those possibilities have been completely ruled out. Show that it Works The code you submit to Forge should work perfectly, and it\u2019s up to you to convince the reviewers that it does. One of the best ways to do that is to add an example mod or junit test to Forge that makes use of your new code and shows it working. To set up and run a Forge Environment with the example mods, see this guide . Breaking Changes in Forge Forge can\u2019t make changes that break the mods that depend on it. This means that Pull Requests have to ensure that they do not break binary compatibility with previous Forge versions. A change that breaks binary compatibility is called a Breaking Change. There are some exceptions to this, Forge accepts Breaking Changes at the beginning of new Minecraft versions, where Minecraft itself already causes Breaking Changes for modders. Sometimes an emergency breaking change is required outside of that time window, but it is rare and can cause dependency headaches for everyone in the modded Minecraft community. Outside of those exceptional times Pull Requests with breaking changes are not accepted, they must be adapted to support the old behavior or wait for the next Minecraft version. Be Patient, Civil, and Empathetic When submitting Pull Requests you will often have to survive code review and make several changes before it is the best Pull Request possible. Keep in mind that code review is not judgement against you. Bugs in your code are not personal. Nobody is perfect, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re working together. Negativity will not help, threatening to give up on your Pull Request and write a coremod instead will just make people upset and make the modded ecosystem worse. It\u2019s important that while working together you assume the best intentions of the people who are reviewing your Pull Request and not take things personally. Review If you do your best to understand the slow and perfectionistic nature of the Pull Request process, we will do our best to understand your point of view as well. After your Pull Request has been reviewed and cleaned up to the best of everyone\u2019s ability, it will be marked for a final review by Lex, who has the final say on what is included in the project or not.","title":"PR Guidelines"},{"location":"forgedev/prguidelines/#pull-request-guidelines","text":"Mods are built on top of Forge, but there are some things that Forge doesn\u2019t support, and that limits what mods can do. When modders run into something like that, they can make a change to Forge to support it, and submit that change as a Pull Request on Github. To make the best use of both your and the Forge team\u2019s time, it is recommended to follow some rough guidelines when preparing a Pull Request. The following points are the most important aspects to keep in mind when it comes to writing a good Pull Request.","title":"Pull Request Guidelines"},{"location":"forgedev/prguidelines/#what-exactly-is-forge","text":"At a high level, Forge is a mod compatibility layer on top of Minecraft. Early mods edited Minecraft\u2019s code directly (like coremods do now), but ran into conflicts with each other when they edited the same things. They also ran into issues when one mod changed behavior in ways that the other mods could not anticipate (like coremods do now), causing mysterious issues and lots of headaches. By using something like Forge, mods can centralize common changes and avoid conflicts. Forge also includes supporting structures for common mod features like Capabilities, Registries, Fluid handling, the Ore Dictionary, and others that allow mods to work together better. When writing a good Forge Pull Request, you also have to know what Forge is at a lower level. There are two main types of code in Forge: Minecraft patches, and Forge code.","title":"What Exactly is Forge?"},{"location":"forgedev/prguidelines/#patches","text":"Patches are applied as direct changes to Minecraft\u2019s source code, and aim to be as minimal as possible. Every time Minecraft code changes, all the Forge patches need to be looked over carefully and applied correctly to the new code. This means that large patches that change lots of things are difficult to maintain, so Forge aims to avoid those and keep patches as small as possible. In addition to making sure the code makes sense, reviews for patches will focus on minimizing the size. There are many strategies to make small patches, and reviews will often point out better methods to do things. Forge patches often insert a single line that fires an event or a code hook, which affects the code after it if the event meets some condition. This allows most of the code to exist outside of the patch, which keeps the patch small and simple. For more detailed information about creating patches, see the GitHub wiki .","title":"Patches"},{"location":"forgedev/prguidelines/#forge-code","text":"Aside from the patches, Forge code is just normal Java code. It can be event code, compatibility features, or anything else that\u2019s not directly editing Minecraft code. When Minecraft updates, Forge code has to update just like everything else. However, it\u2019s much easier because it is not directly entangled in the Minecraft code. Because this code stands on its own, there is no size restriction like there is with the patches.

The rest of this documentation is about where to go from here. From Zero to Modding Obtain a source distribution from forge\u2019s files site. (Look for the Mdk file type, or Src in older 1.8/1.7 versions). Extract the downloaded source distribution to an empty directory. You should see a bunch of files, and an example mod is placed in src/main/java for you to look at. Only a few of these files are strictly necessary for mod development, and you may reuse these files for all your projects These files are: build.gradle gradlew.bat gradlew the gradle folder Move the files listed above to a new folder, this will be your mod project folder. Open up a command prompt in the folder you created in step (3), then run gradlew setupDecompWorkspace . This will download a bunch of artifacts from the internet needed to decompile and build Minecraft and forge. This might take some time, as it will download stuff and then decompile Minecraft. Note that, in general, these things will only need to be downloaded and decompiled once, unless you delete the gradle artifact cache. Choose your IDE: Forge explicitly supports developing with Eclipse or IntelliJ environments, but any environment, from Netbeans to vi/emacs, can be made to work. For Eclipse, you should run gradlew eclipse - this will download some more artifacts for building eclipse projects and then place the eclipse project artifacts in your current directory. For IntelliJ, simply import the build.gradle file. Load your project into your IDE. For Eclipse, create a workspace anywhere (though the easiest location is one level above your project folder). Then simply import your project folder as a project, everything will be done automatically. For IntelliJ, you only need to create run configs. You can run gradlew genIntellijRuns to do this. Note In case you will receive an error while running the task :decompileMC ( the fourth step ) Execution failed for task ':decompileMc'. GC overhead limit exceeded assign more RAM into gradle by adding org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2G into the file ~/.gradle/gradle.properties (create file if doesn\u2019t exist). The ~ sign means it\u2019s a user\u2019s home directory . Terminal-free IntelliJ IDEA configuration These instructions assume that you have created the project folder as described in the steps 1 to 3 of the section above. Because of that, the numbering starts at 4. Launch IDEA and choose to open/import the build.gradle file, using the default gradle wrapper choice. While you wait for this process to finish, you can open the gradle panel, which will get filled with the gradle tasks once importing is completed. Run the setupDecompWorkspace task (inside the forgegradle task group). It will take a few minutes, and use quite a bit of RAM. If it fails, you can add -Xmx3G to the Gradle VM options in IDEA\u2019s gradle settings window, or edit your global gradle properties. Once the setup task is done, you will want to run the genIntellijRuns task, which will configure the project\u2019s run/debug targets. After it\u2019s done, you should click the blue refresh icon on the gradle panel (there\u2019s another refresh icon on the main toolbar, but that\u2019s not it). This will re-synchronize the IDEA project with the Gradle data, making sure that all the dependencies and settings are up to date. Finally, assuming you use IDEA 2016 or newer, you will have to fix the classpath module. Go to Edit configurations and in both Minecraft Client and Minecraft Server , change Use classpath of module to point to the task with a name like <project>_main . If all the steps worked correctly, you should now be able to choose the Minecraft run tasks from the dropdown, and then click the Run/Debug buttons to test your setup. Customizing Your Mod Information Edit the build.gradle file to customize how your mod is built (the file names, versions, and other things). Important Do not edit the buildscript {} section of the build.gradle file, its default text is necessary for ForgeGradle to function. Almost anything underneath apply project: forge and the // EDITS GO BELOW HERE marker can be changed, many things can be removed and customized there as well. There is a whole site dedicated to customizing the forge build.gradle files - the ForgeGradle cookbook . Once you\u2019re comfortable with your mod setup, you\u2019ll find many useful recipes there. Simple build.gradle Customizations These customizations are highly recommended for all projects. To change the name of the file you build - edit the value of archivesBaseName to suit. To change your \u201cmaven coordinates\u201d - edit the value of group as well. To change the version number - edit the value of version . Building and Testing Your Mod To build your mod, run gradlew build . This will output a file in build/libs with the name [archivesBaseName]-[version].jar . This file can be placed in the mods folder of a forge enabled Minecraft setup, and distributed. To test run with your mod, the easiest way is to use the run configs that were generated when you set up your project. Otherwise, you can run gradlew runClient . This will launch Minecraft from the <runDir> location, including your mod code. There are various customizations to this command. Consult the ForgeGradle cookbook for more information. You can also run a dedicated server using the server run config, or gradlew runServer . This will launch the Minecraft server with its GUI.

The value of this parameter should be a valid URL pointing to an update JSON file. This file can be hosted on your own web server, or on GitHub, or wherever you want, as long as it can be reliably reached by all users of your mod. Update JSON format The JSON itself has a relatively simple format, given as follows: { \"homepage\": \"<homepage/download page for your mod>\", \"<mcversion>\": { \"<modversion>\": \"<changelog for this version>\", // List all versions of your mod for the given Minecraft version, along with their changelogs ... }, ... \"promos\": { \"<mcversion>-latest\": \"<modversion>\", // Declare the latest \"bleeding-edge\" version of your mod for the given Minecraft version \"<mcversion>-recommended\": \"<modversion>\", // Declare the latest \"stable\" version of your mod for the given Minecraft version ... } } This is fairly self-explanatory, but some notes: The link under homepage is the link the user will be shown when the mod is outdated. Forge uses an internal algorithm to determine whether one version String of your mod is \u201cnewer\u201d than another.

Packaging Pick a unique package name. If you own a URL associated with your project, you can use it as your top level package. For example if you own \u201cexample.com\u201d, you may use com.example as your top level package. Important If you do not own a domain, do not use it for your top level package. It is perfectly acceptable to start your package with anything, such as your name/nickname, or the name of the mod. After the top level package (if you have one) you append a unique name for your mod, such as examplemod . In our case it will end up as com.example.examplemod . The mcmod.info file This file defines the metadata of your mod. Its information may be viewed by users from the main screen of the game through the Mods button. A single info file can describe several mods. When a mod is annotated by the @Mod annotation, it may define the useMetadata property, which defaults to false . When useMetadata is true , the metadata within mcmod.info overrides whatever has been defined in the annotation. The mcmod.info file is formatted as JSON, where the root element is a list of objects and each object describes one modid. It should be stored as src/main/resources/mcmod.info . A basic mcmod.info , describing one mod, may look like this: [{ \"modid\": \"examplemod\", \"name\": \"Example Mod\", \"description\": \"Lets you craft dirt into diamonds. This is a traditional mod that has existed for eons. It is ancient. The holy Notch created it. Jeb rainbowfied it. Dinnerbone made it upside down.

Here is a table of attributes that may be given to a mod, where required means there is no default and the absence of the property causes an error. In addition to the required properties, you should also define description , version , mcversion , url , and authorList . Property Type Default Description modid string required The modid this description is linked to. If the mod is not loaded, the description is ignored. name string required The user-friendly name of this mod. description string \"\" A description of this mod in 1-2 paragraphs. version string \"\" The version of the mod. mcversion string \"\" The Minecraft version. url string \"\" A link to the mod\u2019s homepage. updateUrl string \"\" Defined but unused.

Using this allows modules of another mod to be listed under it in the info page, like BuildCraft. useDependencyInformation boolean false If true and Mod.useMetadata , the below 3 lists of dependencies will be used. If not, they do nothing. requiredMods [string] [] A list of modids. If one is missing, the game will crash. This does not affect the ordering of mod loading! To specify ordering as well as requirement, have a coupled entry in dependencies . dependencies [string] [] A list of modids. All of the listed mods will load before this one. If one is not present, nothing happens. dependants [string] [] A list of modids. All of the listed mods will load after this one. If one is not present, nothing happens. A good example mcmod.info that uses many of these properties is BuildCraft . The Mod File Generally, we\u2019ll start with a file named after your mod, and put into your package. This is the entry point to your mod and will contain some special indicators marking it as such. What is @Mod ? This is an annotation indicating to the Forge Mod Loader that the class is a Mod entry point. It contains various metadata about the mod. It also designates the class that will receive @EventHandler events. Here is a table of the properties of @Mod : Property Type Default Description modid String required A unique identifier for the mod. It must be lowercased, and will be truncated to 64 characters in length. name String \u201d\u201c A user-friendly name for the mod. version String \u201d\u201c The version of the mod. It should be just numbers seperated by dots, ideally conforming to Semantic Versioning . Even if useMetadata is set to true , it\u2019s a good idea to put the version here anyways. dependencies String \u201d\u201c Dependencies for the mod. The specification is described in the Forge @Mod javadoc: A dependency string can start with the following four prefixes: \"before\" , \"after\" , \"required-before\" , \"required-after\" ; then \":\" and the modid . Optionally, a version range can be specified for the mod by adding \"@\" and then the version range. * If a \u201crequired\u201d mod is missing, or a mod exists with a version outside the specified range, the game will not start and an error screen will tell the player which versions are required. useMetadata boolean false If set to true, properties in @Mod will be overridden by mcmod.info . clientSideOnly serverSideOnly boolean boolean false false If either is set to true , the jar will be skipped on the other side, and the mod will not load. If both are true, the game crashes. acceptedMinecraftVersions String \u201d\u201c The version range of Minecraft the mod will run on. * An empty string will match all versions. acceptableRemoteVersions String \u201d\u201c Specifies a remote version range that this mod will accept as valid. * \"\" Matches the current version, and \"*\" matches all versions. Note that \"*\" matches even when the mod is not present on the remote side at all. acceptableSaveVersions String \u201d\u201c A version range specifying compatible save version information. * If you follow an unusual version convention, use SaveInspectionHandler instead. certificateFingerprint String \u201d\u201c See the tutorial on jar signing . modLanguage String \u201cjava\u201d The programming language the mod is written in. Can be either \"java\" or \"scala\" . modLanguageAdapter String \u201d\u201c Path to a language adapter for the mod. The class must have a default constructor and must implement ILanguageAdapter . If it doesn\u2019t, Forge will crash. If set, overrides modLanguage . canBeDeactivated boolean false This is not implemented, but if the mod could be deactivated (e.g. a minimap mod), this would be set to true and the mod would receive FMLDeactivationEvent to perform cleanup tasks. guiFactory String \u201d\u201c Path to the mod\u2019s GUI factory, if one exists. GUI factories are used to make custom config screens, and must implement IModGuiFactory . For an example, look at FMLConfigGuiFactory . updateJSON String \u201d\u201c URL to an update JSON file. See Forge Update Checker * All version ranges use the Maven Version Range Specification . You can find an example mod in the Forge src download . Keeping Your Code Clean Using Sub-packages Rather than clutter up a single class and package with everything, it is recommended you break your mod into subpackages. A common subpackage strategy has packages for common and client code, which is code that can be run on server/client and client, respectively. Inside the common package would go things like Items, Blocks, and Tile Entities (which can each in turn be another subpackage). Things like GUIs and Renderers would go inside the client package. Note This package style is only a suggestion, though it is a commonly used style. Feel free to use your own packaging system. By keeping your code in clean subpackages, you can grow your mod much more organically. Class Naming Schemes A common class naming scheme allows easier deciphering of what a class is, and also makes it easier for someone developing with your mod to find things. For Example: An Item called PowerRing would be in an item package, with a class name of ItemPowerRing . A Block called NotDirt would be in a block package, with a class name of BlockNotDirt . Finally, a TileEntity for a block called SuperChewer would be a tile or tileentity package, with a class name of TileSuperChewer . Prepending your class names with what kind of object they are makes it easier to figure out what a class is, or guess the class for an object.","title":"Structuring Your Mod"},{"location":"gettingstarted/structuring/#structuring-your-mod","text":"We\u2019ll look at how to organize your mod into different files and what those files should do.","title":"Structuring Your Mod"},{"location":"gettingstarted/structuring/#packaging","text":"Pick a unique package name.

They are used in vanilla to generate random chest loot as well as for mob drops. The vanilla wiki describes the loot table JSON format in great detail, so this article instead will focus on code that you might have to write to use and manipulate loot tables in your mod. To get the most out of this article, read the aforementioned wiki page in its entirety before reading this article. Registering a Modded Loot Table In order to make Minecraft load and be aware of your loot table, simply call LootTableList.register(new ResourceLocation(\"modid\", \"loot_table_name\")) , which will resolve and load /assets/modid/loot_tables/loot_table_name.json . This call can be made during any of preinit, init, or postinit. You may organize your tables into folders freely. Note Loot pools in mod loot tables must include an additional name tag that uniquely identifies that pool within the table. A common strategy is to name the pool with the kinds of items that its entries contain. If you specify multiple loot entries with the same name tag (e.g. the same item but with different functions each time), then you must give each of those entries an entryName tag that uniquely identifies that entry within the pool. For name tags that do not clash, then entryName is automatically set to the value of name . These additional requirements are imposed by Forge to facilitate modification of tables at load time using LootTableLoadEvent (see below). Registering Custom Objects In addition to vanilla\u2019s, you can also register your own loot conditions, loot functions, and entity properties. Entity properties are solely for use of the minecraft:entity_properties loot condition, and are used to test if entities involved in the looting (the looted entity or the killer) have certain properties. The only property in vanilla is minecraft:on_fire . All three are registered similarly, by calling LootConditionManager.registerCondition , LootFunctionManager.registerFunction() , or EntityPropertyManager.registerProperty() , respectively. The methods take a Serializer instance, which takes the ID of the object as a ResourceLocation , and the Class implementing the behavior in code - LootCondition , LootFunction , and EntityProperty , respectively. Since you register the JSON serializer and deserializer, you can require additional fields when using your condition, function, or property. See the vanilla implementations in net.minecraft.world.storage.loot.{conditions, functions, properties} for examples. Then, in order to use your conditions, functions, or properties, simply specify the registry name you passed to the Serializer constructor. An example loot entry: { \"type\": \"item\", \"name\": \"mymod:myitem\", \"conditions\": [ { \"condition\": \"mymod:mycondition\", \"foo\": 1, // can require custom parameters in deserializer }, { \"condition\": \"minecraft:entity_properties\", \"entity\": \"this\", \"properties\": { \"mymod:my_property\": { // structure of the right side is completely up to deserializer \"bar\": 2 } } } ], \"functions\": [ { \"function\": \"mymod:myfunction\", \"foobar\": 3 // can require custom parameters in deserializer } ] } Modifying Vanilla Loot Overview Not only can you specify your own loot tables, conditions, functions, and entity properties, you can also modify others as they load. Note Users are allowed by vanilla to place their own loot tables in the world save directory to override the game\u2019s (and mods\u2019) own tables. These are considered config files and thus cannot be modified by the methods described below, by design . The entry point to modifying tables at runtime is LootTableLoadEvent , which is fired once for each table loaded. From here, you may query and remove pools by name, or add instances of LootPool . This is why modded loot pools are required to have names. You might be wondering how we modify vanilla tables, then, since they do not have names. Forge resolves this by generating names for all pools in vanilla tables. The first pool is named main , since many tables only have one pool. Subsequent pools are named by position: pool1 for the second pool, pool2 for the third, and so on. Removing a pool does not shift the names of the other pools. Within each LootPool , you may also modify the roll and bonus roll attributes of the pool (how many times the table will call this pool) as well as query and remove entries by name, or add instances of LootEntry . Similar to the case for pools, entries need unique names for retrieval and removal. Forge resolves this by adding a hidden entryName field to all loot entries. If the entry\u2019s name field is unique within the pool, then entryName is automatically set to name . Otherwise, a name must be specified in modded entries, and is automatically generated for vanilla entries. For each repeat, a number is incremented. For example, if there are three entries in a vanilla pool each with name: \"minecraft:stick\" , then the three entryName tags generated would be minecraft:stick , minecraft:stick#0 , and minecraft:stick#1 . Likewise, removing an entry does not shift the names of the other entries. Note You must perform all of your desired changes to the table during that table\u2019s LootTableLoadEvent , any changes afterward are disallowed by safety checks or will cause undefined behavior if the safety checks are bypassed. Adding Dungeon Loot Next, an example of one of the most common use cases for modifying vanilla loot: adding dungeon item spawns. First, listen for the event for the table we want to modify: @SubscribeEvent public void lootLoad(LootTableLoadEvent evt) { if (evt.getName().toString().equals(\"minecraft:chests/simple_dungeon\")) { // do stuff with evt.getTable() } } In this case, we are adding to the potential spawns, but don\u2019t want to interfere with the entry weights of the preexisting pools. The most flexible and simple solution is to add another pool with a single loot entry referencing your own loot table JSON, because loot entries are able to recursively draw from a completely different table. For example, your mod might include /assets/mymod/loot_tables/inject/simple_dungeon.json : { \"pools\": [ { \"name\": \"main\", \"rolls\": 1, \"entries\": [ { \"type\": \"item\", \"name\": \"minecraft:nether_star\", \"weight\": 40 }, { \"type\": \"empty\", \"weight\": 60 } ] } ] } Note You still need to register this table with LootTableList.register() ! Then the loot entry and pool are created and added, resulting in a new loot pool for dungeon chests that has a 60% chance of nothing and 40% of a nether star. LootEntry entry = new LootEntryTable(new ResourceLocation(\"mymod:inject/simple_dungeon\"), <weight>, <quality>, <conditions>, <entryName>); // weight doesn't matter since it's the only entry in the pool. Other params set as you wish. LootPool pool = new LootPool(new LootEntry[] {entry}, <conditions>, <rolls>, <bonusRolls>, <name>); // Other params set as you wish. evt.getTable().addPool(pool); Of course, if the loot you want to add cannot be determined ahead of time, you can freely construct and add LootPool s and implementations of LootEntry in your event handler similar to the calls shown above. A real-world example of this approach in action can be seen in Botania. The event handler is located here , and the injected tables are located here . Changing Mob Drops Subclasses of EntityLiving automatically support drawing from a loot table upon death. This is done by overriding the getLootTable method to return a ResourceLocation to the desired table.

This call can be made during any of preinit, init, or postinit. You may organize your tables into folders freely. Note Loot pools in mod loot tables must include an additional name tag that uniquely identifies that pool within the table. A common strategy is to name the pool with the kinds of items that its entries contain. If you specify multiple loot entries with the same name tag (e.g. the same item but with different functions each time), then you must give each of those entries an entryName tag that uniquely identifies that entry within the pool. For name tags that do not clash, then entryName is automatically set to the value of name .

Entity properties are solely for use of the minecraft:entity_properties loot condition, and are used to test if entities involved in the looting (the looted entity or the killer) have certain properties. The only property in vanilla is minecraft:on_fire . All three are registered similarly, by calling LootConditionManager.registerCondition , LootFunctionManager.registerFunction() , or EntityPropertyManager.registerProperty() , respectively. The methods take a Serializer instance, which takes the ID of the object as a ResourceLocation , and the Class implementing the behavior in code - LootCondition , LootFunction , and EntityProperty , respectively. Since you register the JSON serializer and deserializer, you can require additional fields when using your condition, function, or property. See the vanilla implementations in net.minecraft.world.storage.loot.{conditions, functions, properties} for examples. Then, in order to use your conditions, functions, or properties, simply specify the registry name you passed to the Serializer constructor. An example loot entry: { \"type\": \"item\", \"name\": \"mymod:myitem\", \"conditions\": [ { \"condition\": \"mymod:mycondition\", \"foo\": 1, // can require custom parameters in deserializer }, { \"condition\": \"minecraft:entity_properties\", \"entity\": \"this\", \"properties\": { \"mymod:my_property\": { // structure of the right side is completely up to deserializer \"bar\": 2 } } } ], \"functions\": [ { \"function\": \"mymod:myfunction\", \"foobar\": 3 // can require custom parameters in deserializer } ] }","title":"Registering Custom Objects"},{"location":"items/loot_tables/#modifying-vanilla-loot","text":"","title":"Modifying Vanilla Loot"},{"location":"items/loot_tables/#overview","text":"Not only can you specify your own loot tables, conditions, functions, and entity properties, you can also modify others as they load. Note Users are allowed by vanilla to place their own loot tables in the world save directory to override the game\u2019s (and mods\u2019) own tables. These are considered config files and thus cannot be modified by the methods described below, by design . The entry point to modifying tables at runtime is LootTableLoadEvent , which is fired once for each table loaded. From here, you may query and remove pools by name, or add instances of LootPool . This is why modded loot pools are required to have names. You might be wondering how we modify vanilla tables, then, since they do not have names. Forge resolves this by generating names for all pools in vanilla tables. The first pool is named main , since many tables only have one pool. Subsequent pools are named by position: pool1 for the second pool, pool2 for the third, and so on. Removing a pool does not shift the names of the other pools. Within each LootPool , you may also modify the roll and bonus roll attributes of the pool (how many times the table will call this pool) as well as query and remove entries by name, or add instances of LootEntry . Similar to the case for pools, entries need unique names for retrieval and removal. Forge resolves this by adding a hidden entryName field to all loot entries. If the entry\u2019s name field is unique within the pool, then entryName is automatically set to name . Otherwise, a name must be specified in modded entries, and is automatically generated for vanilla entries. For each repeat, a number is incremented. For example, if there are three entries in a vanilla pool each with name: \"minecraft:stick\" , then the three entryName tags generated would be minecraft:stick , minecraft:stick#0 , and minecraft:stick#1 . Likewise, removing an entry does not shift the names of the other entries. Note You must perform all of your desired changes to the table during that table\u2019s LootTableLoadEvent , any changes afterward are disallowed by safety checks or will cause undefined behavior if the safety checks are bypassed.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"items/loot_tables/#adding-dungeon-loot","text":"Next, an example of one of the most common use cases for modifying vanilla loot: adding dungeon item spawns. First, listen for the event for the table we want to modify: @SubscribeEvent public void lootLoad(LootTableLoadEvent evt) { if (evt.getName().toString().equals(\"minecraft:chests/simple_dungeon\")) { // do stuff with evt.getTable() } } In this case, we are adding to the potential spawns, but don\u2019t want to interfere with the entry weights of the preexisting pools. The most flexible and simple solution is to add another pool with a single loot entry referencing your own loot table JSON, because loot entries are able to recursively draw from a completely different table. For example, your mod might include /assets/mymod/loot_tables/inject/simple_dungeon.json : { \"pools\": [ { \"name\": \"main\", \"rolls\": 1, \"entries\": [ { \"type\": \"item\", \"name\": \"minecraft:nether_star\", \"weight\": 40 }, { \"type\": \"empty\", \"weight\": 60 } ] } ] } Note You still need to register this table with LootTableList.register() ! Then the loot entry and pool are created and added, resulting in a new loot pool for dungeon chests that has a 60% chance of nothing and 40% of a nether star. LootEntry entry = new LootEntryTable(new ResourceLocation(\"mymod:inject/simple_dungeon\"), <weight>, <quality>, <conditions>, <entryName>); // weight doesn't matter since it's the only entry in the pool. Other params set as you wish. LootPool pool = new LootPool(new LootEntry[] {entry}, <conditions>, <rolls>, <bonusRolls>, <name>); // Other params set as you wish. evt.getTable().addPool(pool); Of course, if the loot you want to add cannot be determined ahead of time, you can freely construct and add LootPool s and implementations of LootEntry in your event handler similar to the calls shown above.

When ResourceLocation refers to a model, the path is normally relative to models (e.g. examplemod:block/block \u2192 assets/examplemod/models/block/block ). A notable exception is within a blockstate JSON (all 3 formats), where model paths are relative to models/block (e.g. examplemod:block \u2192 assets/examplemod/models/block/block ). Block and item models differ in a few ways, the major one being item property overrides . Textures Textures, like models, are contained within resource packs and are referred to with ResourceLocation s. When ResourceLocation s refer to textures in models, the paths are taken to be relative to textures/ (e.g. examplemod:blocks/test \u2192 assets/examplemod/textures/blocks/test.png ). Additionally, in Minecraft, the UV coordinates (0,0) are taken to mean the top-left corner. UVs are always from 0 to 16. If a texture is larger or smaller, the coordinates are scaled to fit. A texture must also be square, and the side length of a texture should be a power of two, as doing otherwise breaks mipmapping. (E.g. 1x1, 2x2, 8x8, 16x16, and 128x128 are good. 5x5 and 30x30 are not recommended because they are not powers of 2. 5x10 and 4x8 are completely broken as they are not square.) If there is an mcmeta file associated with the texture, and an animation is defined, the image can be rectangular and is interpreted as a vertical sequence of square regions from top to bottom, where each square is a frame of the animation. JSON Models Vanilla Minecraft\u2019s JSON model format is rather simple. It defines cuboid (cube/rectangular prism) elements, and assigns textures to their faces. On the wiki , there is a definition of its format. Note JSON models only support cuboid elements; there is no way to express a triangular wedge or anything like it. To have more complicated models, another format must be used.

For modded item properties, it is recommended that the modid of the mod is used as the namespace (e.g. examplemod:property and not just property , as that really means minecraft:property ).","title":"Adding Properties to Items"},{"location":"models/overrides/#using-overrides","text":"The format of an override can be seen on the wiki , and a good example can be found in model/item/bow.json .

An IBlockState is mapped to a ModelResourceLocation by an IStateMapper . The default statemapper, which works by default for all blocks, works as follows: Get the registry name of the blockstate\u2019s block. Set said name as the ResourceLocation part of the ModelResourceLocation . Get all properties and their values in the blockstate. Get the name of each property with IProperty#getName . Get the name of each value with IProperty<T>#getName(T) . Sort the pairs alphabetically by the name of the property only . Produce a comma delimited string of key-value pairs (e.g. a=b,c=d,e=f ). Set that as the variant part of the ModelResourceLocation . If the variant string is empty (i.e. no properties defined), default the variant to normal . The variant string is silently toLowerCase d, so if a statemapper returns mod:model#VARIANT , the game will query the JSON for the string \u201cvariant\u201d, not \u201cVARIANT.\u201d Custom IStateMapper s It\u2019s simple to use a custom IStateMapper . Once an instance is acquired, it may be registered with a call to ModelLoader.setCustomStateMapper . IStateMapper s are registered per block, so this method receives both the IStateMapper and the block it works on. There is also a builder StateMap.Builder for some common use cases. StateMap.Builder The builder StateMap.Builder can create IStateMapper s for some of the most common use cases. Once one is instantiated, methods can be called to set its parameters, and a call to build will generate an IStateMapper using those parameters. withName withName takes a property as argument and sets that as the \u201cname\u201d (actually the path) of the returned ModelResourceLocation . When the resulting IStateMapper is applied to a blockstate, it takes the value of the property given, then finds the name for that value, and uses that as the resource path. It is clearer with an example: PropertyDirection PROP_FACING = PropertyDirection.create(\"facing\"); // Start with a property IStateMapper mapper = new StateMap.Builder().withName(PROP_FACING).build(); // Use the builder Now, if mapper is asked to find the ModelResourceLocation for the blockstate examplemod:block1[facing=east] , it will map it to examplemod:east#normal . Given examplemod:block2[color=red,facing=north] , it will map it to examplemod:north#color=red . withSuffix The suffix is a plain string that gets tacked on to the end of the resource path. For example, if the suffix is set to _suff , the resulting IStateMapper will map the blockstate examplemod:block[facing=east] to the ModelResourceLocation examplemod:block_suff#facing=east . ignore This causes the IStateMapper to simply ignore the given properties when mapping a blockstate. When called twice, the two lists are merged. An example: PropertyDirection PROP_OUT = PropertyDirection.create(\"out\"); PropertyDirection PROP_IN = PropertyDirection.create(\"in\"); // These two are equivalent IStateMapper together = new StateMap.Builder().ignore(PROP_OUT, PROP_IN).build(); IStateMapper merged = new StateMap.Builder().ignore(PROP_OUT).ignore(PROP_IN).build(); When either together or merged are asked to map the blockstate examplemod:block1[in=north,out=south] , they\u2019ll give the ModelResourceLocation examplemod:block1#normal . Given examplemod:block2[in=north,out=south,color=blue] , they\u2019ll produce examplemod:block2#color=blue . Finally, given examplemod:block3[color=white,out=east] (no in ), they\u2019ll produce examplemod:block3#color=white . Item Models Unlike blocks, which automatically have a default IStateMapper that works without any extra registration, items must be registered to their models manually. This is done through ModelLoader.setCustomModelResourceLocation . This method takes the item, a metadata value, and a ModelResourceLocation , and registers a mapping so that all ItemStack s with the item and metadata given use the given ModelResourceLocation for their model. The way the game searches for the model is as follows: For a ModelResourceLocation <namespace>:<path>#<varstr> Attempt to find a custom model loader that volunteers to load this model. If that succeeds, load the model with the found loader and break out of these instructions. If that fails, attempt to load it from the blockstate JSON loader. If that fails, attempt to load it from the vanilla JSON loader (which loads the model assets/<namespace>/models/item/<path>.json ). JSON item models from models/item can also leverage overrides . Note ModelLoader.setCustomModelResourceLocation also calls ModelLoader.registerItemVariants with the item and ModelResourceLocation given. This sets up the model for baking later. ItemMeshDefinition An ItemMeshDefinition is a function that takes ItemStack s and maps them to ModelResourceLocation s. They are registered per item, and this can be done with ModelLoader.setCustomMeshDefinition , which takes an item and the ItemMeshDefinition to use for its ItemStack s. Important ModelLoader.setCustomMeshDefinition does not call ModelLoader.registerItemVariants . Therefore, ModelLoader.registerItemVariants method must be passed every ModelResourceLocation the ItemMeshDefinition can return in order for it to work. Blockstate JSONs for Items Note that items can use block state JSONs. This is possible by simply passing a ModelResourceLocation pointing to a blockstate JSON into ModelLoader.setCustomModelResourceLocation or returning it from an ItemMeshDefinition . Doing so allows the model to take advantage of things like submodels and combining variants. The two main use cases are items that share their models with blocks (especially ItemBlock s) and the default item layer model (The textures block inside combining variant definitions can be used to build up the layers of the model, with one property setting layer0 , another setting layer1 , etc.). Note 1.9 multipart blockstates will not work as item models out of the box, as they require an IBlockState to select a model. Important There is one major caveat. Blockstate JSONs can only resolve paths to models under models/block ; they cannot see models under models/item (even using ../item causes an error). This means that the minecraft:item/generated model (which sets the default transforms for items) cannot be used in a blockstate JSON. As a workaround, the minecraft:builtin/generated model can be used instead and the transforms set with the transform tag in the blockstate JSON. (Block models that inherit from minecraft:block/block already set transforms, so this isn\u2019t necessary for them.)

Ordinary blockstates and properties occupy only a fixed set of possible states, while extended states can form infinite sets. This accomplished through the use of unlisted properties ( IUnlistedProperty<V> ), extended block states ( IExtendedBlockState ), and extended block state containers ( ExtendedBlockState ). Ordinary block state containers ( BlockStateContainer ) take a set of listed properties ( IProperty<V> ) that define all possible values for themselves and use those to create all possible combinatons of values. These combinations are then turned into IBlockState s and stored in the finite set of all possible states. The properties are called \u201clisted\u201d as they appear on the F3 debug screen, all the way to the right. Extended block state containers take a set of listed properties, and also a set of unlisted properties. Unlisted properties\u2019 values can be anything that matches their type, and are not limited to a finite set. However, values are still required to satisfy the predicate IUnlistedProperty::isValid . The listed properties are again used to create the set of states, this time IExtendedBlockState s, but the unlisted properties remain unset. The unlisted properties are only set when IExtendedBlockState::withProperty is called to do so. Most of the methods on IExtendedBlockState are self-explanatory, maybe with the exception of getClean . getClean returns the base IBlockState with none of the unlisted properties set. Why Extended Blockstates Why use extended blockstates at all? Why not simply pass an IBlockAccess and BlockPos into the rendering system directly and have the IBakedModel itself deal with it? Indeed, extended blockstates allow this to happen anyway! Why have the system at all when we could just do that? The reason is that it makes the system more flexible. External code can take an IExtendedBlockState and fill in some data by itself, overriding the block\u2019s own data. This allows that code to alter the model in ways that would be impossible if it was just a black box that took a world and a position and spat out some geometry. One such use case is advanced camouflaging blocks. The camouflaging block may have a tile entity that holds the IBlockState representative of the camouflagee, and an unlisted property to hold that state during rendering. This property can then be filled by getExtendedState . Finally, a custom IBakedModel can steal the model for that state and use it instead of using the uncamouflaged model. Declaring Unlisted Properties Unlisted properties are declared in Block.createBlockState , the same place as regular (\u201clisted\u201d) properties. Instead of returning a BlockStateContainer , one must return an ExtendedBlockState . Forge provides a builder BlockStateContainer.Builder , which will automatically handle returning an ExtendedBlockState for you. Example: @Override public BlockStateContainer createBlockState() { return new BlockStateContainer.Builder(this).add(LISTED_PROP).add(UNLISTED_PROP).build(); } Note that you do not need to set default values for your unlisted properties. Filling Extended States Before an IBlockState is passed to an IBakedModel , it will always have Block.getExtendedState called on it first. In this method, you will give all your unlisted properties values. Assuming you registered at least one unlisted property in the previous section, the IBlockState parameter can be safely casted to IExtendedBlockState , which has a withProperty method for unlisted properties analogous to its listed property cousin. Here, you can query whatever you want from the World, the Tile Entity, etc. (with appropriate safety checks, of course) and insert it into the extended blockstate. Warning It is highly recommended that your unlisted property values be immutable. Baked model implementations will use the extended state and unlisted values on multiple threads, so any value must be used in a threadsafe manner. The easiest way is to simply make that information an immutable snapshot. Anything you might possibly want to know in your custom IBakedModel , you should be passing an immutable snapshot of through Block.getExtendedState . Example: @Override public IExtendedBlockState getExtendedState(IBlockState state, IBlockAccess world, BlockPos pos) { IExtendedBlockState ext = (IExtendedBlockState) state; TileEntity te = world.getTileEntity(pos); if (te instanceof MyTE) { ext = ext.withProperty(UNLISTED_PROP, ((MyTE) te).getSomeImmutableData()); } return ext; } Using Extended States In a custom IBakedModel , the IBlockState parameter passed to you will be exactly the object you returned in Block.getExtendedState , and you can pull data out of it and use it to affect your rendering as you wish.

This is how a model is represented right after it has been loaded. Usually this directly represents the source of the model (e.g. an object deserialized from JSON, or an OBJ container). At this high level, a model has no concept of items, blocks, or anything of that sort; it purely represents a shape. Important IModel is immutable. Methods such as process that alter the model should never mutate the IModel , as they should construct new IModel s instead. getDependencies This is a collection of the ResourceLocation s of all the models this model depends on. These models are guaranteed to be loaded before this one is baked. For example, a model deserialized from a blockstate JSON will depend on the models defined within. Only models that are directly mapped to a block/item are loaded normally; to ensure loading of other models, they must be declared as dependencies of another. Cyclic dependencies will cause a LoaderException to be thrown. getTextures This is a collection of the ResourceLocation s of all the textures this model depends on. These textures are guaranteed to be loaded before this model is baked. For example, a vanilla JSON model depends on all the textures defined within. bake This is the main method of IModel . It takes an IModelState , a VertexFormat , and a function ResourceLocation \u2192 TextureAtlasSprite , to return an IBakedModel . IBakedModel is less abstract than IModel , and it is what interacts with blocks and items. The function ResourceLocation \u2192 TextureAtlasSprite is used to get textures from ResourceLocation s (i.e. the ResourceLocation s of textures are passed to this function and the returned TextureAtlasSprite contains the texture). process This method allows a model to process extra data from external sources. The Forge blockstate variant format provides a way to define this data in the resource pack. Within the Forge blockstate format, the property that is used to pass this data is called custom . First, an example: { \"forge_marker\": 1, \"defaults\": { \"custom\": { \"__comment\": \"These can be any JSON primitives with any names, but models should only use what they understand.\", \"meaningOfLife\": 42, \"showQuestion\": false }, \"model\": \"examplemod:life_meaning\" }, \"variants\": { \"dying\": { \"true\": { \"__comment\": \"Custom data is inherited. Therefore, here `meaningOfLife` is inherited but `showQuestion` is overriden. The model itself remains inherited.\", \"custom\": { \"showQuestion\": true } }, \"false\": {} } } } As seen above, custom data can be of any type. Additionally, it is inherited from the defaults into the variants. The custom data is passed in as an ImmutableMap<String, String> . This is a map where the keys are the property names (in the above example, \u201cmeaningOfLife\u201d, \u201cshowQuestion\u201d, and \u201ctitle\u201d). Astute observers may notice that numeric and boolean data were defined in within the blockstate but this method only receives String s. This is because all data is converted into strings before being processed. If a model does not understand what a property means, it should just ignore it. smoothLighting In vanilla, smooth lighting enables ambient occlusion. This flag can be controlled by the smooth_lighting property in a Forge blockstate (which can appear wherever a model property can and is inherited). The default implementation does nothing. gui3D gui3D controls whether a model looks \u201cflat\u201d in certain positions (e.g. with gui3d set to true , EntityItem renders a stack with multiple items as several layers of the model. With gui3d set to false , the item is always one layer), and also controls lighting inside GUIs. This flag can be controlled by the gui3d property in a Forge blockstate. The default implementation does nothing. retexture This method is used to change the textures a model might use. This is similar to how texture variables in vanilla JSON models work. A model can start out with certain faces with certain textures, and then by setting/overriding texture variables these faces can be changed. An example: { \"forge_marker\": 1, \"defaults\": { \"textures\": { \"varA\": \"examplemod:items/hgttg\", \"varB\": \"examplemod:blocks/earth\", \"varC\": \"#varA\", \"varZ\": null }, \"model\": \"examplemod:universe\" } } In this example, the textures block will be deserialized as-is into an ImmutableMap with the exception that null s are turned into \"\" (i.e. the final result is \"varA\" \u2192 \"examplemod:items/hgttg\", \"varB\" \u2192 \"examplemod:blocks/earth\", \"varC\" \u2192 \"#varA\", \"varZ\" \u2192 \"\" ). Then, retexture is called to change the textures as needed. How this is done is up to the model. It may be advisable, however, to support resolving texture variables such as \u201c#var\u201d (like vanilla JSON models) instead of taking them literally. The default implementation does nothing. uvlock This method is used to toggle UV lock. UV lock means that when the model itself rotates, the textures applied to the model do not rotate with it. The default implementation does nothing. This can be controlled with the uvlock property in a Forge blockstate. An example: { \"forge_marker\": 1, \"defaults\": { \"model\": \"minecraft:half_slab\", \"textures\": { \"__comment\": \"Texture definitions here...\" } }, \"variants\": { \"a\": [{ \"__comment\": \"No change\" }], \"b\": [{ \"__comment\": \"This is like literally taking the slab and flipping it upside down.

A set of ModelResourceLocation s are marked as models to be loaded through ModelLoader . For items, their models must be manually marked for loading with ModelLoader.registerItemVariants . ( ModelLoader.setCustomModelResourceLocation does this.) For blocks, their statemappers produce a Map<IBlockState, ModelResourceLocation> .

If none is found and the ResourceLocation is actually a ModelResourceLocation (that is, this is not a normal model; it\u2019s actually a blockstate variant), it goes to the blockstate loader ( VariantLoader ). Otherwise the model is a normal vanilla JSON model and is loaded the vanilla way ( VanillaLoader ). A vanilla JSON model ( models/item/*.json or models/block/*.json ), when loaded, is a ModelBlock (yes, even for items). This is a vanilla class that is not related to IModel in any way. To rectify this, it gets wrapped into a VanillaModelWrapper , which does implement IModel . A vanilla/Forge blockstate variant, when loaded, first loads the entire blockstate JSON it comes from. The JSON is deserialized into a ModelBlockDefinition that is then cached to the path of the JSON. A list of variant definitions is then extracted from the ModelBlockDefinition and placed into a WeightedRandomModel . When loading a vanilla JSON item model ( models/item/*.json ), the model is requested from a ModelResourceLocation with variant inventory (e.g. the dirt block item model is minecraft:dirt#inventory ); thereby causing the model to be loaded by VariantLoader (as it is a ModelResourceLocation ). When VariantLoader fails to load the model from the blockstate JSON, it falls back to VanillaLoader . The most important side-effect of this is that if an error occurs in VariantLoader , it will try to also load the model via VanillaLoader . If this also fails, then the resulting exception produces two stacktraces. The first is the VanillaLoader stacktrace, and the second is from VariantLoader . When debugging model errors, it is important to ensure that the right stacktrace is being analyzed. An IModel can be loaded from a ResourceLocation or retrieved from the cache by invoking ModelLoaderRegistry.getModel or one of the exception handling alternatives. All texture dependencies of the loaded models are loaded and stitched into the atlas. The atlas is a giant texture that contains all the model textures pasted together. When a model refers to a texture, during rendering, an extra UV offset is applied to match the texture\u2019s position in the atlas. Every model is baked by calling model.bake(model.getDefaultState(), ...) . The resulting IBakedModel s are cached in a Map<ModelResourceLocation, IBakedModel> .

It introduces submodels, which allows you to build the final blockstate from different parts. Attention Note that all models and textures referenced are from vanilla minecraft. For your own mod, you have to use the full location! For example: \"mymod:blocks/blockTexture\" . You don\u2019t have to use Forge\u2019s blockstate format at all, you can also use the vanilla format! General Structure of the Format { \"forge_marker\": 1, \"defaults\": { \"textures\": { \"all\": \"blocks/dirt\" }, \"model\": \"cube_all\", \"uvlock\": true }, \"variants\": { \"normal\": [{}] } } This json declares a simple blockstate that has dirt on each side. Let\u2019s go through it step by step. \"forge_marker\": 1, This tells the game that the blockstate json is the one from Forge, not from vanilla Minecraft. The 1 is the version of the format, which ensures that old blockstate JSONs can be supported should the format ever change. Currently there is only this one. \"defaults\": { \"textures\": { \"all\": \"blocks/dirt\" }, \"model\": \"cube_all\", \"uvlock\": true } The defaults section contains the default values for all variants. They can be overwritten by the variants. The defaults section is optional ! You do not need to define defaults, the block can be omitted altogether. \"variants\": { \"normal\": [{}] } This defines all variants for the block. The simple dirt block only has its default, the normal variant. It does not contain any additional information in this case. Everything that is defined in defaults could also be defined here. For example: \"normal\": [{ \"textures\": { \"side\": \"blocks/cobblestone\", \"end\": \"blocks/dirt\" }, \"model\": \"cube_column\" }] This normal variant would use the cube_column model with cobblestone on the sides and dirt on top and bottom. An entry in the variants section either defines a blockstate property or a plain variant. A property definition is of the form: \"variants\": { \"property_name\": { \"value0\": {}, \"value1\": {}, \"__comment\": \"Etc.\" } } A given blockstate can have any number of these. When the blockstate is loaded, the values within each property are used to create all possible variants for the block. The above would create two variants, property_name=value0 and property_name=value1 . If there were two properties, it would create variants prop1=value11,prop2=value21 , prop1=value12,prop2=value21 , prop1=value11,prop2=value22 , and so on (where the property names are sorted alphabetically). Each such variant is the union of all the variant definitions that went into it. For example, given: { \"forge_marker\": 1, \"variants\": { \"shiny\": { \"true\": { \"textures\": { \"all\": \"some:shiny_texture\" } }, \"false\": { \"textures\": { \"all\": \"some:flat_texture\" } } }, \"broken\": { \"true\": { \"model\": \"some:broken_model\" }, \"false\": { \"model\": \"some:intact_model\" } } } } The variant \u201cbroken=false,shiny=true\u201d takes the \u201csome:intact_model\u201d from variants.broken.true.model , and the some:shiny_texture from variants.shiny.true.textures . An entry can also be a plain variant, like: \"variants\": { \"normal\": { \"model\": \"some:model\" } } This kind of definition defines a variant \u201cnormal\u201d directly, without forming combinations with those listed in the property-value format. It still inherits from a \u201cdefaults\u201d block, if present, and if the property-value formatted variants generate a variant with the same name, the directly defined variant combines with and overrides values from it. If the variant is defined as a list, then each element is a variant definition, and the one that will be used is random: \"defaults\": { \"model\": \"some:model\" } \"variants\": { \"__comment\": \"When used, the model will have a 75% chance of being rotated.\", \"normal\": [{ \"y\": 0 }, { \"y\": 90 }, { \"y\": 180 }, { \"y\": 270 }] } A property definition is disambiguated from a straight variant by the type of the first entry. If the first entry of variants.<something> is an object, then it is a property definition. If it is anything else, it is a straight variant. In order to avoid mixups, it is recommended to wrap straight variants in a list with one element: \"variants\": { \"simple\": [{ \"custom\": {}, \"model\": \"some:model\", \"__comment\": \"Without the list, the custom: {} would make Forge think this was a property definition.\" }] } Sub-Models To show the use of submodels we will create a model that has different variants. Each variant will use submodels to create a different model. The model will be a pressure plate, and depending on its state it will have parts added to it. { \"forge_marker\": 1, \"defaults\": { \"textures\": { \"texture\": \"blocks/planks_oak\", \"wall\": \"blocks/planks_oak\" }, \"model\": \"pressure_plate_up\", \"uvlock\": true }, \"variants\": { \"__comment\": \"mossy is a boolean property.\", \"mossy\": { \"true\": { \"__comment\": \"If true it changes the pressure plate from oak planks to mossy cobble.\", \"textures\": { \"texture\": \"blocks/cobblestone_mossy\" } }, \"false\": { \"__comment\": \"Change nothing.

In this example it\u2019s quite straight forward: If mossy is true , the pressure plate uses the mossy cobblestone texture If pillarCount is 1 it will add one wall with connection facing north. The default texture for the wall is oak-planks. If pillarCount is 2 it will add two walls, both facing north. However the second wall will be rotated by 90 degree. This showcases that you do not need separate model with Forge\u2019s system. You only need once and rotate it around the Y axis. Additionally the texture of the walls is changed to cobblestone.

A variant string can be absolutely anything, from \u201cinventory\u201d to \u201cpower=5\u201d to \u201cI am your father.\u201d They represent an actual model, where the blockstate is just a container for them. In code, a variant string within a blockstate JSON is represented by a ModelResourceLocation . When the game searches for a model corresponding to a block in the world, it takes the blockstate for that position, and then it uses an IStateMapper to find the corresponding ModelResourceLocation for it, which then refers to the actual model. The default IStateMapper uses the block\u2019s registry name as the location of the blockstate JSON. (E.g. block examplemod:testblock goes to the ResourceLocation examplemod:testblock .) The variant string is pieced together from the blockstate\u2019s properties. More information can be found here . As an example, let\u2019s take a look at the vanilla oak_log.json : { \"variants\": { \"axis=y\": { \"model\": \"oak_log\" }, \"axis=z\": { \"model\": \"oak_log_side\" }, \"axis=x\": { \"model\": \"oak_log_side\", \"y\": 90 }, \"axis=none\": { \"model\": \"oak_bark\" } } } Here we define 4 variant strings, and for each we use a certain model, either the upright log, the sideways log (rotated or not), and the all bark model (this model is not seen normally in vanilla; you have to use /setblock to create it). Since logs use the default IStateMapper , these variants will define the look of a log depending on the property axis . A blockstate always has to be defined for all possible variant strings. When you have many properties, this results in lots of possible variants, as every combination of properties must be defined. In Minecraft 1.8\u2019s blockstate format, you have to define every string explicitly, which leads to long, complicated files. It also doesn\u2019t support the concept of submodels, or multiple models in the same blockstate. In order to allievate this, Forge introduced its own blockstate format , which is available in Minecraft 1.8 and up. Starting from Minecraft 1.9, Mojang also introduced the \u201cmultipart\u201d format. You can find a definition of its format on the wiki . Forge\u2019s format and the multipart format are not better than each other; they each cover different use cases and it is your choice which one you want to use. Note The Forge format is really more like syntactic sugar for automatically calculating the set of all possible variants for you behind the scenes. This allows you to use the resulting ModelResourceLocation s for things other than blocks. ( Such as items . This is also true of the 1.8 format, but there is almost no reason to use that format.) The 1.9 format is a more complicated system that depends on having an IBlockState to pick the model. It will not directly work in other contexts without some code around it. For reference, here\u2019s an excerpt from the 1.8 blockstate for fences, fence.json : \"east=true,north=false,south=false,west=false\": { \"model\": \"oak_fence_n\", \"y\": 90, \"uvlock\": true } This is just one variant out of 16. Even worse, there are 6 models for fences, one each for no connections, one connection, two connections in a straight line, two perpendicular connections, three connections, and one for all four connections. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the same file in 1.9, which uses the multipart format: { \"when\": { \"east\": \"true\" }, \"apply\": { \"model\": \"oak_fence_side\", \"y\": 90, \"uvlock\": true } } This is one case of 5.

A variant string can be absolutely anything, from \u201cinventory\u201d to \u201cpower=5\u201d to \u201cI am your father.\u201d They represent an actual model, where the blockstate is just a container for them. In code, a variant string within a blockstate JSON is represented by a ModelResourceLocation . When the game searches for a model corresponding to a block in the world, it takes the blockstate for that position, and then it uses an IStateMapper to find the corresponding ModelResourceLocation for it, which then refers to the actual model. The default IStateMapper uses the block\u2019s registry name as the location of the blockstate JSON. (E.g. block examplemod:testblock goes to the ResourceLocation examplemod:testblock .) The variant string is pieced together from the blockstate\u2019s properties. More information can be found here . As an example, let\u2019s take a look at the vanilla oak_log.json : { \"variants\": { \"axis=y\": { \"model\": \"oak_log\" }, \"axis=z\": { \"model\": \"oak_log_side\" }, \"axis=x\": { \"model\": \"oak_log_side\", \"y\": 90 }, \"axis=none\": { \"model\": \"oak_bark\" } } } Here we define 4 variant strings, and for each we use a certain model, either the upright log, the sideways log (rotated or not), and the all bark model (this model is not seen normally in vanilla; you have to use /setblock to create it). Since logs use the default IStateMapper , these variants will define the look of a log depending on the property axis . A blockstate always has to be defined for all possible variant strings. When you have many properties, this results in lots of possible variants, as every combination of properties must be defined. In Minecraft 1.8\u2019s blockstate format, you have to define every string explicitly, which leads to long, complicated files. It also doesn\u2019t support the concept of submodels, or multiple models in the same blockstate. In order to allievate this, Forge introduced its own blockstate format , which is available in Minecraft 1.8 and up. Starting from Minecraft 1.9, Mojang also introduced the \u201cmultipart\u201d format. You can find a definition of its format on the wiki . Forge\u2019s format and the multipart format are not better than each other; they each cover different use cases and it is your choice which one you want to use. Note The Forge format is really more like syntactic sugar for automatically calculating the set of all possible variants for you behind the scenes. This allows you to use the resulting ModelResourceLocation s for things other than blocks. ( Such as items . This is also true of the 1.8 format, but there is almost no reason to use that format.) The 1.9 format is a more complicated system that depends on having an IBlockState to pick the model. It will not directly work in other contexts without some code around it. For reference, here\u2019s an excerpt from the 1.8 blockstate for fences, fence.json : \"east=true,north=false,south=false,west=false\": { \"model\": \"oak_fence_n\", \"y\": 90, \"uvlock\": true } This is just one variant out of 16. Even worse, there are 6 models for fences, one each for no connections, one connection, two connections in a straight line, two perpendicular connections, three connections, and one for all four connections. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the same file in 1.9, which uses the multipart format: { \"when\": { \"east\": \"true\" }, \"apply\": { \"model\": \"oak_fence_side\", \"y\": 90, \"uvlock\": true } } This is one case of 5. You can read this as \u201cwhen east=true, use the model oak_fence_side rotated 90 degrees\u201d. This allows the final model to be built up from 5 smaller parts, 4 of which (the connections) are conditional and the 5th being the unconditional central post. This uses only two models, one for the post, and one for the side connection.","title":"Introduction to Blockstate JSONs"},{"location":"networking/","text":"Networking Communication between servers and clients is the backbone of a successful mod implementation.

Using this system is by far the easiest way to send custom data between clients and the server. Getting Started First you need to create your SimpleNetworkWrapper object. We recommend that you do this in a separate class, possibly something like ModidPacketHandler . Create your SimpleNetworkWrapper as a static field in this class, like so: public static final SimpleNetworkWrapper INSTANCE = NetworkRegistry.INSTANCE.newSimpleChannel(\"mymodid\"); Where \"mymodid\" is a short identifier for your packet channel, typically just your mod ID, unless that is unusually long. Making Packets IMessage A packet is defined by using the IMessage interface. This interface defines 2 methods, toBytes and fromBytes . These methods, respectively, write and read the data in your packet to and from a ByteBuf object, which is an object used to hold a stream (array) of bytes which are sent through the network. For an example, let\u2019s define a small packet that is designed to send a single int over the network: public class MyMessage implements IMessage { // A default constructor is always required public MyMessage(){} private int toSend; public MyMessage(int toSend) { this.toSend = toSend; } @Override public void toBytes(ByteBuf buf) { // Writes the int into the buf buf.writeInt(toSend); } @Override public void fromBytes(ByteBuf buf) { // Reads the int back from the buf. Note that if you have multiple values, you must read in the same order you wrote. toSend = buf.readInt(); } } IMessageHandler Now, how can we use this packet? Well, first we must have a class that can handle this packet. This is created with the IMessageHandler interface. Say we wanted to use this integer we sent to give the player that many diamonds on the server. Let\u2019s make this handler: // The params of the IMessageHandler are <REQ, REPLY> // This means that the first param is the packet you are receiving, and the second is the packet you are returning. // The returned packet can be used as a \"response\" from a sent packet. public class MyMessageHandler implements IMessageHandler<MyMessage, IMessage> { // Do note that the default constructor is required, but implicitly defined in this case @Override public IMessage onMessage(MyMessage message, MessageContext ctx) { // This is the player the packet was sent to the server from EntityPlayerMP serverPlayer = ctx.getServerHandler().playerEntity; // The value that was sent int amount = message.toSend; // Execute the action on the main server thread by adding it as a scheduled task serverPlayer.getServerWorld().addScheduledTask(() -> { serverPlayer.inventory.addItemStackToInventory(new ItemStack(Items.DIAMOND, amount)); }); // No response packet return null; } } It is recommended (but not required) that for organization\u2019s sake, this class is an inner class to your MyMessage class. If this is done, note that the class must also be declared static . Warning As of Minecraft 1.8 packets are by default handled on the network thread. That means that your IMessageHandler can not interact with most game objects directly. Minecraft provides a convenient way to make your code execute on the main thread instead using IThreadListener.addScheduledTask . The way to obtain an IThreadListener is using either the Minecraft instance (client side) or a WorldServer instance (server side). The code above shows an example of this by getting a WorldServer instance from an EntityPlayerMP . Warning Be defensive when handling packets on the server. A client could attempt to exploit the packet handling by sending unexpected data. A common problem is vulnerability to arbitrary chunk generation . This typically happens when the server is trusting a block position sent by a client to access blocks and tile entities. When accessing blocks and tile entities in unloaded areas of the world, the server will either generate or load this area from disk, then promply write it to disk. This can be exploited to cause catastrophic damage to a server\u2019s performance and storage space without leaving a trace. To avoid this problem, a general rule of thumb is to only access blocks and tile entities if world.isBlockLoaded(pos) is true. Registering Packets So now we have a packet, and a handler for this packet. But the SimpleNetworkWrapper needs one more thing to function! For it to use a packet, the packet must be registered with an discriminator , which is just an integer used to map packet types between server and client. To do this, call INSTANCE.registerMessage(MyMessageHandler.class, MyMessage.class, 0, Side.Server); where INSTANCE is the SimpleNetworkWrapper we defined earlier. This is quite a complex method, so lets break it down a bit. The first parameter is messageHandler , which is the class that handles your packet. This class must always have a default constructor, and should have type bound REQ that matches the next argument. The second parameter is requestMessageType which is the actual packet class. This class must also have a default constructor and match the REQ type bound of the previous param. The third parameter is the discriminator for the packet. This is a per-channel unique ID for the packet. We recommend you use a static variable to hold the ID, and then call registerMessage using id++ . This will guarantee 100% unique IDs. The fourth and final parameter is the side that your packet will be received on. If you are planning to send the packet to both sides, it must be registered twice, once to each side. Discriminators can be the same between sides, but are not required to be. Using Packets When sending packets, make sure that there is a handler registered on the receiving side for said packet. If there is not, the packet will be sent across the network and then thrown away, resulting in a \u201cleaked\u201d packet. This is harmless other than needless network usage, but should still be fixed. Sending to the Server There is but one way to send a packet to the server. This is because there is only ever one server, and only one way to send to that server, of course. To do so, we must again use that SimpleNetworkWrapper that was defined earlier. Simply call INSTANCE.sendToServer(new MyMessage(toSend)) . The message will be sent to the Side.SERVER IMessageHandler for its type, if one exists. Sending to Clients There are four different methods of sending packets to clients: sendToAll - Calling INSTANCE.sendToAll will send the packet once to every single player on the current server, no matter what location or dimension they are in. sendToDimension - INSTANCE.sendToDimension takes two arguments, an IMessage and an integer. The integer is the dimension ID to send to, which can be gotten with world.provider.getDimension() . The packet will be sent to all players currently in the given dimension. sendToAllAround - INSTANCE.sendToAllAround requires an IMessage and a NetworkRegistry.TargetPoint object. All players within the TargetPoint will have the packet sent to them. A TargetPoint requires a dimension (see #2), x/y/z coordinates, and a range. It represents a sphere with radius of range, centered at (x, y, z) in a world. sendTo - INSTANCE.sendTo is is the option for sending packets to a single client. This requires an IMessage and an EntityPlayerMP to which to send the packet. Note that though this is not the more generic EntityPlayer , as long as you are on the server you can safely cast any EntityPlayer to EntityPlayerMP . sendToAllTracking - Last but not least, there is also INSTANCE.sendToAllTracking which sends packets to all players on the server who are \u201ctracking\u201d the target. There are two variants of sendToAllTracking : one accepts a TargetPoint , and another one accepts an Entity . For the former, all clients that has the block located at TargetPoint loaded will receive the packet; for the latter, all clients that are within the tracking range of supplied Entity will receive the packet. Do note that EntityPlayer s will not track themselves, so this cannot replace the use of sendTo ; if the EntityPlayer that is used as target also requires syncing, you need to call sendTo on that before calling the Entity version of sendToAllTracking . Note The two variants of sendToAllTracking are not interchangeable - for the version that accepts TargetPoint , TargetPoint.range field is ignored; for the version that accepts Entity , the tracking range of said Entity is respected, and the actual values vary on different Entity . As such, one cannot use one of them to emulate the effect of the other. You should choose the one that fits your actual situation best.","title":"SimpleImpl"},{"location":"networking/simpleimpl/#simpleimpl","text":"SimpleImpl is the name given to the packet system that revolves around the SimpleNetworkWrapper class.

A TESR requires the block to have a TileEntity. By default OpenGL (via GlStateManager ) is used to handle rendering in a TESR. See the OpenGL documentation to learn more. It is recommended to use a FastTESR instead whenever possible. Creating a TESR To create a TESR, create a class that inherits from TileEntitySpecialRenderer . It takes a generic argument specifying the block\u2019s TileEntity class. The generic argument is used in the TESR\u2019s renderTileEntityAt method. Only one TESR exists for a given tile entity. Therefore, values that are specific to a single instance in the world should be stored in the tile entity being passed to the renderer rather than in the TESR itself. For example, an integer that increments every frame, if stored in the TESR, will increment every frame for every tile entity of this type in the world. renderTileEntityAt This method is called every frame in order to render the tile entity. Parameters tileentity : This is the instance of the tile entity being rendered. x , y , z : The position at which the tile entity should be rendered. partialTicks : The amount of time, in fractions of a tick, that has passed since the last full tick. destroyStage : The destroy stage for the block if it is being broken. Registering a TESR In order to register a TESR, call ClientRegistry#bindTileEntitySpecialRenderer passing the tile entity class to be renderer with this TESR and the instance of the TESR to use to render all TEs of this class. FastTESR A TESR can opt-in to being a FastTESR by extending the FastTESR class instead of TileEntitySpecialRenderer and returning true from TileEntity#hasFastRenderer . Instead of implementing renderTileEntityAt , renderTileEntityFast must be implemented. A FastTESR can offer performance improvements over a traditional TESR and should be used wherever possible. This is due to the fact that all FastTESR instances are batched together and only issue one combined draw call for all FastTESRs per frame to the GPU.

They are used to store dynamic data, execute tick based tasks and for dynamic rendering. Some examples from vanilla Minecraft would be: handling of inventories (chests), smelting logic on furnaces, or area effects for beacons. More advanced examples exist in mods, such as quarries, sorting machines, pipes, and displays. Note TileEntities aren\u2019t a solution for everything and they can cause lag when used wrongly. When possible, try to avoid them. Creating a TileEntity In order to create a TileEntity you need to extend the TileEntity class. It is important that your TileEntity has a default constructor, so that Minecraft can properly load it. After you\u2019ve created your class, you need to register the TileEntity . For this you need to call GameRegistry#registerTileEntity(Class<? extends TileEntity> tileEntityClass, ResourceLocation key) Where the first parameter is simply your TileEntity class and the second the registry name of your TileEntity. At this point you can either choose to do it during the FMLPreInitializationEvent or during the RegistryEvent.Register<Block> event, as TileEntities don\u2019t have their own Registry Event yet. Note The method to register a TileEntity is using a String instead of a ResourceLocation before Forge version 14.23.3.2694 This method creates a ResourceLocation from the String. Be sure to use the ResourceLocation format modid:tile_entity to avoid it being called minecraft:tile_entity. Attaching a TileEntity to a Block To attach your new TileEntity to a Block you need to override 2 (two) methods within the Block class. Block#hasTileEntity(IBlockstate state) Block#createTileEntity(World world, IBlockState state) Using the parameters you can choose if the block should have a TileEntity or not. Usually you will return true in the first method and a new instance of your TileEntity in the second method. Storing Data within your TileEntity In order to save data, override the following two methods TileEntity#writeToNBT(NBTTagCompound nbt) TileEntity#readFromNBT(NBTTagCompound nbt) These methods are called whenever the Chunk containing the TileEntity gets loaded from/saved to NBT. Use them to read and write to the fields in your tile entity class. Note Whenever your data changes you need to call TileEntity#markDirty() , otherwise the Chunk containing your TileEntity might be skipped while the world is saved. Important It is important that you call the super methods! The tag names id , x , y , z , ForgeData and ForgeCaps are reserved by the super methods. Keeping a TileEntity through changing BlockStates There might be situations in which you need to change your BlockState , such as with the vanilla furnace, which changes its state from lit=false to lit=true when fuel and something smeltable is inside. Achieving this is rather simple, by overriding following method TileEntity#shouldRefresh(World world, BlockPos pos, IBlockState oldState, IBlockState newSate) Important You should actually check the BlockStates and not just return false in order to prevent unwanted behavior and bugs. Especially as this method is also called when your Block(State) is replaced by another one, Air for example. Ticking TileEntities If you need a ticking TileEntity , for example to keep track of the progress during a smelting process, you need to add the net.minecraft.util.ITickable interface to your TileEntity . Now you can implement all your calculations within ITickable#update() Note This method is called each tick, therefore you should avoid having complicated calculations in here. If possible, you should make more complex calculations just every X ticks. (The amount of ticks in a second may be lower then 20 (twenty) but won\u2019t be higher) Synchronizing the Data to the Client There are 3 (three) ways of syncing data to the client. Synchronizing on chunk load, synchronizing on block updates and synchronizing with a custom network message. Synchronizing on chunk load For this you need to override TileEntity#getUpdateTag() TileEntity#handleUpdateTag(NBTTagCompound nbt) Again, this is pretty simple, the first method collects the data that should be send to the client, while the second one processes that data. If your TileEntity doesn\u2019t contain much data you might be able to use the methods out of the Storing Data within your TileEntity section. Important Synchronizing excessive/useless data for TileEntities can lead to network congestion. You should optimize your network usage by sending only the information the client needs when the client needs it. For instance, it is more often that not unnecessary to send the inventory of a tile entity in the update tag, as this can be synchronized via its GUI. Synchronizing on block update This method is a bit more complicated, but again you just need to override 2 methods. Here is a tiny example implementation of it @Override public SPacketUpdateTileEntity getUpdatePacket(){ NBTTagCompound nbtTag = new NBTTagCompound(); //Write your data into the nbtTag return new SPacketUpdateTileEntity(getPos(), 1, nbtTag); } @Override public void onDataPacket(NetworkManager net, SPacketUpdateTileEntity pkt){ NBTTagCompound tag = pkt.getNbtCompound(); //Handle your Data } The Constructor of SPacketUpdateTileEntity takes: The position of your TileEntity . An ID, though it isn\u2019t really used besides by Vanilla, therefore you can just put a 1 in there. An NBTTagCompound which should contain your data. Additionally to this you now need to cause a \u201cBlockUpdate\u201d on the Client. World#notifyBlockUpdate(BlockPos pos, IBlockState oldState, IBlockState newState, int flags) The pos should be your TileEntitiy\u2019s position. For oldState and newState you can pass the current BlockState at that position. The flags are a bitmask and should contain 2, which will sync the changes to the client. Synchronizing using a custom network message This way of synchronizing is probably the most complicated one, but is usually also the most optimized one, as you can make sure that only the data you need to be synchronized is actually synchronized. You should first check out the Networking section and especially SimpleImpl before attempting this. Once you\u2019ve created your custom network message, you can send it to all users that have the TileEntity loaded with: SimpleNetworkWrapper#sendToAllTracking(IMessage, NetworkRegistry.TargetPoint) Warning It is important that you do safety checks, the TileEntity might already be destroyed/replaced when the message arrives at the player!

Since then it has been adopted by Forge as well and will be expanded in Minecraft 1.13 into datapacks. Loading Recipes Forge will load all recipes which can be found within the ./assets/<modid>/recipes/ folder. You can call these files whatever you want, thought the vanilla convention is to name them after the output item. This name is also used as the registration key, but does not affect the operation of the recipe. Note Recipe files cannot begin with an underscore as this is reserved for constants files. The JSON file extension is required. The Recipe file A basic recipe file might look like the following example: { \"type\": \"minecraft:crafting_shaped\", \"pattern\": [ \"xxa\", \"x x\", \"xxx\" ], \"key\": { \"x\": { \"type\": \"forge:ore_dict\", \"ore\": \"gemDiamond\" }, \"a\": { \"item\": \"mymod:myfirstitem\", \"data\": 1 } }, \"result\": { \"item\": \"mymod:myitem\", \"count\": 9, \"data\": 2 } } Note When you first obtain an ingredient to a vanilla recipe it will automatically unlock the recipe in the recipe book. To achieve the same effect, you have to use the Advancement system and create a new Advancement for each of your ingredients. The advancement has to exist. This doesn\u2019t mean it has to be visible in the advancement tree. Type The type of a recipe with the type field. You can think of this as the definition of which crafting layout is to be used, for example minecraft:crafting_shaped or minecraft:crafting_shapeless . If you want, you can define your own types as well which requires the use of a _factories.json file. Groups Optionally you can add a group to your recipes to be displayed within the recipe helper interface. All recipes with the same group String will be shown in the same group. For example, this can be used to have all door recipes shown in the recipe helper interface as a single entry, even though there are different types of doors. Types of crafting recipes Within this section we will take a closer look on the differences between defining a shaped and a shapeless crafting recipe. Shaped crafting Shaped recipes require the pattern and key keywords. A pattern defines the slot an item must appear in using placeholder characters. You can choose whatever character you want to be a placeholder for an item. Keys on the other hand define what items are to be used instead of the placeholders. A key is defined by a placeholder character and the item. Additional the type forge:ore_dict may be added. This defines the item beeing part of the OreDictionary and can for example be used when it doesn\u2019t matter which copper ore is used to produce a copper ingot. In this case the ore tag has to be used instead of the item tag to define the item. There are many more of these types which can be used here and you can even register your own. The data tag is a optional and used to define the metadata of a block or item. Important Any item which uses setHasSubtypes(true) requires the use of the data field. When it is not used within the ingredients or keys, it will mean any metadata of this item will be accepted, for example: Not defining the data of a sword means even a half broken sword will be accepted for the crafting recipe! Shapeless crafting A shapeless recipe doesn\u2019t make use of the pattern and key keywords. To define a shapeless recipe, you have to use the ingredients list. It defines which items have to be used for the crafting process and can also make use of the additional type forge:ore_dict and it\u2019s functionality as described above. There are many more of these types which can be used here and you can even register your own. It is even possible to define multiple instances of the same item which means multiple of these items have to be in place for the crafting recipe to take place. Note While there is no limit on how many ingredients your recipe requires the vanilla crafting table does only allow 9 items to be placed for each crafting recipe. The following example shows how an ingredient list looks like within JSON. \"ingredients\": [ { \"type\": \"forge:ore_dict\", \"ore\": \"gemDiamond\" }, { \"item\": \"minecraft:nether_star\" } ], Smelting To define a recipe for the furnace, you have to use GameRegistry.addSmelting(input, output, exp); as the smelting recipes are currently not JSON based. Recipe Elements Patterns A pattern will be defined with the pattern list. Each string represents one row in the crafting grid and each placeholder character within the String represents a column. As seen in the example above a space means that no item needs to be inserted at that position. Keys A key set is used in combination with patterns and contains keys whose name is the same as the placeholder character in the pattern list which it represents. One key may be defined to represent multiply items as it is the case for the wooden button. This means that the player can use one of the defined items for the crafting recipe, for example different types of wood. \"key\": { \"#\": [ { \"item\": \"minecraft:planks\", \"data\": 0 }, { \"item\": \"minecraft:planks\", \"data\": 1 } ] } Results Every recipe has to have a result tag to define the output item. When crafting something, you can get out more than one item. This is achieved by defining the count number. If this is left out, meaning it doesn\u2019t exist within the result block, it defaults to 1. Negative values are not allowed here as an Itemstack cannot be smaller than 0. There is no option to use the count number anywhere else than for the result. The data field is a optional and used to define the metadata of a block or item. It defaults to 0 when it doesn\u2019t exist. Note Any item which uses setHasSubtypes(true) requires the data field. In this case, it is not optional! Factories Factories can be used to allow defining recipes and ingredients of a custom type (class). To create your own factory, create a _factories.json . Within this file a type has to be defined, for example: recipes , ingredients or conditions . These types represent IRecipeFactory , IIngredientFactory , and IConditionFactory , respectively. The entry \u201ckey\u201d must be a name which can be later used in your recipes, and the \u201cvalue\u201d is the fully qualified class name is a class you have to create which implements one of the above recipes. The class must have an empty constructor. For example: { \"<type>\": { \"<name>\": \"<fully qualified classname for the specified type>\" } } Note There is no need to create a new _factories.json for each type you want to specify, they can all be defined in a single file. Conditional Recipes Conditional recipes can be created by making use of the factory system described above. For this you use the conditions type with the IConditionFactory from above and can later add the conditions type to your recipes: { \"conditions\": [ { \"type\": \"<modid>:<name>\" } ] } These conditions only apply to the recipe as a whole and not to ingredients. As an example, you might want to check if a mod is loaded using the already existing condition forge:mod_loaded , and \"modid\": \"<mod to check>\" . Note Conditions will only be checked once at startup! Constants It is possible to define constant values for your recipes. These values have to be defined within a _constants.json and can be used within any recipe of your mod by just writing #<name> . For filled buckets, you should use fluid instead of data . For example, this constant defines #SADDLE which represents the vanilla saddle item.

A pattern defines the slot an item must appear in using placeholder characters. You can choose whatever character you want to be a placeholder for an item. Keys on the other hand define what items are to be used instead of the placeholders. A key is defined by a placeholder character and the item. Additional the type forge:ore_dict may be added. This defines the item beeing part of the OreDictionary and can for example be used when it doesn\u2019t matter which copper ore is used to produce a copper ingot. In this case the ore tag has to be used instead of the item tag to define the item. There are many more of these types which can be used here and you can even register your own. The data tag is a optional and used to define the metadata of a block or item. Important Any item which uses setHasSubtypes(true) requires the use of the data field.
